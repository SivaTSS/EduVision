Remote vehicles go where humans cant. Yet much of the ocean remains unexplored. Some people call the ocean the last frontier. Humans have had a big impact on the oceans. Populations of fish and other marine species have been overfished. Contaminants are polluting the waters. Global warming is melting the thick ice caps and warming the water. Warmer water expands and, along with water from the melting ice caps, causes sea levels to rise. There are many branches of oceanography.

These scientists work to understand the climate as it is now. They also study how climate will change in response to global warming. The atmosphere contains small amounts of carbon dioxide. Climatologists have found that humans are putting a lot of extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is mostly from burning fossil fuels. The extra carbon dioxide traps heat from the Sun.

Earth-orbiting telescopes view stars and galaxies from the darkness of space (Figure 1.17). They may have optical and radio telescopes to see things that the human eye cant see. Spacecraft travel great distances to send back information on faraway places. Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions. How do strong bursts of energy from the Sun, called solar flares, affect communications? How might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth? What are the properties of black holes?

      "Geology is the study of the solid Earth. Geologists study how rocks and minerals form. The way mountains rise up is part of geology. The way mountains erode away is another part. Geologists also study fossils and Earths history. There are many other branches of geology. There is so much to know about our home planet that most geologists become specialists in one area. For example, a mineralogist studies minerals, as seen in (Figure 1.11). Some volcanologists brave molten lava to study volcanoes. Seismologists monitor earthquakes worldwide to help protect people and property from harm (Figure 1.11). Paleontologists are interested in fossils and how ancient organisms lived. Scientists who compare the geology of other planets to Earth are planetary geologists. Some geologists study the Moon. Others look for petroleum. Still others specialize in studying soil. Some geologists can tell how old rocks are and determine how different rock layers formed. There is probably an expert in almost anything you can think of related to Earth! Geologists might study rivers and lakes, the underground water found between soil and rock particles, or even water that is frozen in glaciers. Earth scientists also need geographers who explore the features of Earths surface and work with cartographers, who make maps. Studying the layers of rock beneath the surface helps us to understand the history of planet Earth (Figure 1.12).\n",
      "\n",
      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.11 (A) Mineralogists focus on all kinds of minerals. (B) Seismographs are used to measure earthquakes and pinpoint their origins.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a display case filled with various rocks and minerals. The display case is divided into three sections, each containing different types of rocks and minerals. The rocks and minerals are arranged in a visually appealing manner, showcasing their unique characteristics.\n",
      "In addition to the rocks and minerals, there are two clocks present in the scene. One clock is located on the left side of the display case, while the other clock is positioned on the right side. These clocks likely help visitors keep track of time during their visit to the exhibit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oceanography is the study of the oceans. The word oceanology might be more accurate, since ology is the study of. Graph is to write and refers to map making. But mapping the oceans is how oceanography started. More than 70% of Earths surface is covered with water. Almost all of that water is in the oceans. Scientists have visited the deepest parts of the ocean in submarines. Remote vehicles go where humans cant. Yet much of the ocean remains unexplored. Some people call the ocean the last frontier. Humans have had a big impact on the oceans. Populations of fish and other marine species have been overfished. Contaminants are polluting the waters. Global warming is melting the thick ice caps and warming the water. Warmer water expands and, along with water from the melting ice caps, causes sea levels to rise. There are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents (Figure 1.13). Marine geology looks at rocks and structures in the ocean basins. Chemical oceanography studies the natural elements in ocean water. Marine biology looks at marine life.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.12 These folded rock layers have bent over time. Studying rock layers helps scientists to explain these layers and the geologic history of the area.. Image Explanation: The image depicts a mountainous landscape with a large, steep cliff in the foreground. The cliff appears to be made of red rock, giving it a striking appearance. In the background, there is a blue sky, adding to the beauty of the scene.\n",
      "A few trees can be seen scattered throughout the landscape, with some closer to the cliff and others further away. The combination of the red rock cliff, the blue sky, and the trees creates a picturesque and serene environment.\n",

Image Explanation: In the image, there is a large red and white ship docked in a harbor. The ship appears to be a crane barge, which is a type of vessel used for lifting and transporting heavy loads. The crane barge is docked next to a large building, which could be a warehouse or another type of facility.\n",
      "There are several birds flying in the sky above the crane barge, adding a sense of liveliness to the scene. Additionally, there are two people visible in the image, likely observing the crane barge or going about their daily activities in the harbor area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meteorologists dont study meteors they study the atmosphere! The word meteor refers to things in the air. Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Meteorology is very important. Using radars and satellites, meteorologists work to predict, or forecast, the weather (Figure 1.14). The atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds Earth. Climatologists study the atmosphere. These scientists work to understand the climate as it is now. They also study how climate will change in response to global warming. The atmosphere contains small amounts of carbon dioxide. Climatologists have found that humans are putting a lot of extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is mostly from burning fossil fuels. The extra carbon dioxide traps heat from the Sun. Trapped heat causes the atmosphere to heat up. We call this global warming (Figure 1.15).\n",
      "\n",
      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.14 Meteorologists can help us to prepare for major storms or know if today is a good day for a picnic.. Image Explanation: The image depicts a dark, cloudy sky above a lush green forest. The sky is filled with clouds, creating a dramatic backdrop for the trees. There are several trees scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the distance. The combination of the dark sky and the vibrant greenery of the forest creates a captivating and serene atmosphere.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.15 Carbon dioxide released into the atmo- sphere is causing global warming.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a group of four smokestacks emitting a significant amount of smoke into the sky. The smokestacks are part of a power plant, and the smoke appears to be a byproduct of the plant's operation. The sky above the smokestacks is cloudy, adding to the overall atmosphere of the scene. The power plant is located near some trees, which can be seen in the foreground of the image.\n",

      "Environmental scientists study the ways that humans affect the planet we live on. We hope to find better ways of living that can also help the environment. Ecologists study lifeforms and the environments they live in (Figure 1.16). They try to predict the chain reactions that could occur when one part of the ecosystem is disrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.16 In a marine ecosystem, coral, fish, and other sea life depend on each other for survival.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a diverse group of colorful fish swimming together in a coral reef. The fish are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The fish vary in size and color, creating a vibrant and lively underwater environment. The coral reef provides a natural habitat for these aquatic creatures, allowing them to thrive and interact with one another.\n",

      "Astronomy and astronomers have shown that the planets in our solar system are not the only planets in the universe. Over 530 planets were known outside our solar system in 2011. And there are billions of other planets! The universe also contains black holes, other galaxies, asteroids, comets, and nebula. As big as Earth seems, the entire universe is vastly more enormous. Earth is just a tiny part of our universe. Astronomers use many tools to study things in space. Earth-orbiting telescopes view stars and galaxies from the darkness of space (Figure 1.17). They may have optical and radio telescopes to see things that the human eye cant see. Spacecraft travel great distances to send back information on faraway places. Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions. How do strong bursts of energy from the Sun, called solar flares, affect communications? How might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth? What are the properties of black holes? Astronomers ask bigger questions too. How was the universe created? Is there life on other planets? Are there resources on other planets that people could use? Astronomers use what Earth scientists know to make comparisons with other planets.\n"

      "In addition to the rocks and minerals, there are two clocks present in the scene. One clock is located on the left side of the display case, while the other clock is positioned on the right side. These clocks likely help visitors keep track of time during their visit to the exhibit.\n",

      "Oceanography is the study of the oceans. The word oceanology might be more accurate, since ology is the study of. Graph is to write and refers to map making. But mapping the oceans is how oceanography started. More than 70% of Earths surface is covered with water. Almost all of that water is in the oceans. Scientists have visited the deepest parts of the ocean in submarines. Remote vehicles go where humans cant. Yet much of the ocean remains unexplored. Some people call the ocean the last frontier. Humans have had a big impact on the oceans. Populations of fish and other marine species have been overfished. Contaminants are polluting the waters. Global warming is melting the thick ice caps and warming the water. Warmer water expands and, along with water from the melting ice caps, causes sea levels to rise. There are many branches of oceanography. Physical oceanography is the study of water movement, like waves and ocean currents (Figure 1.13). Marine geology looks at rocks and structures in the ocean basins. Chemical oceanography studies the natural elements in ocean water. Marine biology looks at marine life.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.12 These folded rock layers have bent over time. Studying rock layers helps scientists to explain these layers and the geologic history of the area.. Image Explanation: The image depicts a mountainous landscape with a large, steep cliff in the foreground. The cliff appears to be made of red rock, giving it a striking appearance. In the background, there is a blue sky, adding to the beauty of the scene.\n",
      "A few trees can be seen scattered throughout the landscape, with some closer to the cliff and others further away. The combination of the red rock cliff, the blue sky, and the trees creates a picturesque and serene environment.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.13 This research vessel is specially designed to explore the seas around Antarctica.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a large red and white ship docked in a harbor. The ship appears to be a crane barge, which is a type of vessel used for lifting and transporting heavy loads. The crane barge is docked next to a large building, which could be a warehouse or another type of facility.\n",
      "There are several birds flying in the sky above the crane barge, adding a sense of liveliness to the scene. Additionally, there are two people visible in the image, likely observing the crane barge or going about their daily activities in the harbor area.\n",

      "Meteorologists dont study meteors they study the atmosphere! The word meteor refers to things in the air. Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Meteorology is very important. Using radars and satellites, meteorologists work to predict, or forecast, the weather (Figure 1.14). The atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds Earth. Climatologists study the atmosphere. These scientists work to understand the climate as it is now. They also study how climate will change in response to global warming. The atmosphere contains small amounts of carbon dioxide. Climatologists have found that humans are putting a lot of extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is mostly from burning fossil fuels. The extra carbon dioxide traps heat from the Sun. Trapped heat causes the atmosphere to heat up. We call this global warming (Figure 1.15).\n",
      "\n",
      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.14 Meteorologists can help us to prepare for major storms or know if today is a good day for a picnic.. Image Explanation: The image depicts a dark, cloudy sky above a lush green forest. The sky is filled with clouds, creating a dramatic backdrop for the trees. There are several trees scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the distance. The combination of the dark sky and the vibrant greenery of the forest creates a captivating and serene atmosphere.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.15 Carbon dioxide released into the atmo- sphere is causing global warming.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a group of four smokestacks emitting a significant amount of smoke into the sky. The smokestacks are part of a power plant, and the smoke appears to be a byproduct of the plant's operation. The sky above the smokestacks is cloudy, adding to the overall atmosphere of the scene. The power plant is located near some trees, which can be seen in the foreground of the image.\n",

      "Environmental scientists study the ways that humans affect the planet we live on. We hope to find better ways of living that can also help the environment. Ecologists study lifeforms and the environments they live in (Figure 1.16). They try to predict the chain reactions that could occur when one part of the ecosystem is disrupted.\n",

      "Image Caption: FIGURE 1.16 In a marine ecosystem, coral, fish, and other sea life depend on each other for survival.. Image Explanation: In the image, there is a diverse group of colorful fish swimming together in a coral reef. The fish are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The fish vary in size and color, creating a vibrant and lively underwater environment. The coral reef provides a natural habitat for these aquatic creatures, allowing them to thrive and interact with one another.\n",

      "Astronomy and astronomers have shown that the planets in our solar system are not the only planets in the universe. Over 530 planets were known outside our solar system in 2011. And there are billions of other planets! The universe also contains black holes, other galaxies, asteroids, comets, and nebula. As big as Earth seems, the entire universe is vastly more enormous. Earth is just a tiny part of our universe. Astronomers use many tools to study things in space. Earth-orbiting telescopes view stars and galaxies from the darkness of space (Figure 1.17). They may have optical and radio telescopes to see things that the human eye cant see. Spacecraft travel great distances to send back information on faraway places. Astronomers ask a wide variety of questions. How do strong bursts of energy from the Sun, called solar flares, affect communications? How might an impact from an asteroid affect life on Earth? What are the properties of black holes? Astronomers ask bigger questions too. How was the universe created? Is there life on other planets? Are there resources on other planets that people could use? Astronomers use what Earth scientists know to make comparisons with other planets.\n",

In the image, there is a close-up view of a ball bearing in a wheel. The ball bearing is made up of various components, such as the outer ring, inner ring, ball, and cage. The outer ring is the outermost part of the bearing, while the inner ring is the innermost part. The ball is the central part of the bearing, and the cage is the part that holds the ball in place.
The image also provides information about the different types of ball bearings, such as radial ball bearings and thrust ball bearings. Radial ball bearings are designed to handle radial loads, while thrust ball bearings are designed to handle axial loads. Additionally, the image highlights the importance of proper maintenance and lubrication of ball bearings to ensure their longevity and performance.

In the image, there is a representation of a longitudinal wave, which is a type of wave that travels along a medium, such as a string or a rod. The wave is depicted as a series of peaks and troughs, with each peak representing a point of maximum displacement and each trough representing a point of minimum displacement.
The wave is labeled with its wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs. The wavelength of the wave in the image is approximately 0.5 meters. The wave is also labeled with its frequency, which is the number of waves that pass a given point in a unit of time. The frequency of the wave in the image is approximately 100 Hz.

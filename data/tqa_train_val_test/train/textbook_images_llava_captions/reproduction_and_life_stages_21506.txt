In the image, there is a close-up view of an endometrium, which is the lining of a woman's uterus. The endometrium is composed of glandular and stromal tissue. The glandular tissue is responsible for producing mucus, which helps to nourish and protect the developing embryo. The stromal tissue, on the other hand, provides support and blood supply to the glandular tissue.

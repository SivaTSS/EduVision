In the image, there is a large body of water with several boats floating on the surface. One of the boats appears to be on fire, emitting a large plume of black smoke. The other boats are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the burning boat and others further away.
In addition to the boats, there are two people visible in the image. One person is located near the center of the scene, while the other person is closer to the right side of the image. The combination of the burning boat, the smoke, and the presence of people creates a dramatic and potentially hazardous scene.

In the image, there are two pictures side by side. The left picture features a jellyfish, while the right picture showcases a firefly. The jellyfish occupies most of the left side of the image, while the firefly takes up a significant portion of the right side of the image. Both the jellyfish and the firefly appear to be in their natural habitats, with the jellyfish floating in the water and the firefly perched on a plant.

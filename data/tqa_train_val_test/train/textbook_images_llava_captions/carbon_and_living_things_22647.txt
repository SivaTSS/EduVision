In the image, there is a close-up view of a DNA molecule. The molecule is labeled with the names of the four bases that make up DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases are arranged in a double helix structure, with the two strands of DNA running parallel to each other.
In addition to the DNA molecule, there is a diagram of a sugar phosphate backbone, which is a part of the DNA structure. The backbone consists of alternating sugar and phosphate groups, forming a staircase-like pattern.
Overall, the image provides a detailed look at the structure and components of a DNA molecule, as well as the sugar phosphate backbone that forms an essential part of the DNA structure.

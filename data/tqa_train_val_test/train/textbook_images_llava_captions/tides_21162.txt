The image depicts a close-up view of the Earth, showcasing its oceans, continents, and atmosphere. The Earth is divided into two main sections: the low tide area and the high tide area. The low tide area consists of the majority of the Earth's surface, while the high tide area is the area that is submerged by the oceans during high tide.
The Earth is surrounded by the atmosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to about 7 to 16 kilometers (4 to 10 miles) in altitude. The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere, extending from about 16 to 50 kilometers (10 to 31 miles) in altitude. The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere, extending from about 50 to 85 kilometers (31 to 53 miles) in altitude. Finally, the thermosphere is the highest layer of the atmosphere, extending from about

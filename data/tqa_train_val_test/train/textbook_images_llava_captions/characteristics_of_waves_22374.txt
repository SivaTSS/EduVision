In the image, there is a graph showing the motion of a rock. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the motion of the rock. The graph shows that the motion of the rock is described by a sine wave. The motion of the rock starts from the left side of the graph and moves towards the right side, following the pattern of a sine wave. The motion of the rock can be described as a sine wave, indicating that the rock's motion is periodic and follows a specific pattern.

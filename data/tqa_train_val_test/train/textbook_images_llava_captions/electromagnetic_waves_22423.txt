In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the concept of a vibrating charged parcel (left) and a vibrating electric and magnetic field (below). The parcel is described as a "vibrating charged parcel," while the field is referred to as an "electric field" and a "magnetic field."
The diagram consists of three main sections: the parcel, the electric field, and the magnetic field. The parcel is located on the left side of the image, while the electric field occupies the central part of the image, and the magnetic field is situated on the right side of the image.
Additionally, there are two arrows in the image. One arrow is pointing towards the parcel, and the other arrow is pointing towards the magnetic field. These arrows help to emphasize the relationship between the parcel and the electric and magnetic fields.

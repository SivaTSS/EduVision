In the image, there are two diagrams displayed. The first one is a 3D representation of a mountain, while the second one is a 2D representation of the same mountain. The 2D representation is placed next to the 3D representation, providing a comparison between the two.
In the 3D representation, the mountain is depicted as a large, jagged rock formation. The 2D representation, on the other hand, shows the mountain as a flat, rectangular shape. This comparison highlights the differences between the 3D and 2D representations of the same mountain.

In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between the amount of grain and the size of the grain. The x-axis represents the amount of grain, while the y-axis shows the size of the grain in millimeters. The graph is labeled "Hjulstrom's Curves," which indicates that it is a representation of the relationship between the size of the grain and the amount of grain.
The graph shows that as the amount of grain increases, the size of the grain decreases, and vice versa. The relationship between the amount of grain and the size of the grain is not a straight line, but rather a curved line, which is characteristic of Hjulstrom's Curves.
Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between the amount of grain and the size of the grain, which can be useful in understanding the properties of grains.

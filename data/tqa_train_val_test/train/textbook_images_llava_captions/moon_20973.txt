In the image, there are two side-by-side photographs of the moon. The photographs show the moon at different stages of its orbit around the Earth. The first photograph captures the moon in the early stages of its orbit, while the second photograph shows the moon in the later stages of its orbit. The photographs provide a clear visual representation of the moon's movement throughout the night.

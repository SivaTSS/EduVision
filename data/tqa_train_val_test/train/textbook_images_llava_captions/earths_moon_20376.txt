In the image, there are two side-by-side photographs of the moon. The first photograph is on the left side of the image, and the second photograph is on the right side of the image. Both photographs show the moon in different stages of its orbit around the Earth.
In the first photograph, the moon appears to be in the waxing gibbous phase, while in the second photograph, the moon appears to be in the waning gibbous phase. This difference in the moon's position in the sky indicates that the photographs were taken at different times, capturing the moon at different stages of its orbit.

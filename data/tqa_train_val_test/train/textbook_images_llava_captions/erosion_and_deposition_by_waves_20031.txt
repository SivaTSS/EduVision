The image depicts a sandy beach with numerous shells scattered across the ground. The shells come in various shapes and sizes, creating a visually appealing scene. Some of the shells are larger and more prominent, while others are smaller and less noticeable.
In addition to the shells, there are a few birds present in the scene. One bird is located near the top left corner of the image, while another bird can be seen in the top right corner. These birds add a sense of liveliness to the otherwise serene beach setting.

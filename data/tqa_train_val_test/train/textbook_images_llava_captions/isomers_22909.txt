This is a diagram of a molecule. The molecule is made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms, forming a chain-like structure. The molecule is shaped like a diamond, with the carbon atoms forming the corners and the hydrogen atoms connecting the corners. The diagram is in black and white, making it easier to see the structure of the molecule. This type of molecule is commonly found in organic compounds, such as plastics and fuels.

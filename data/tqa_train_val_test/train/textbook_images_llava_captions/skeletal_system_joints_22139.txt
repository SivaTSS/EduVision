In the image, there is a close-up view of a human skull with a crack in it. The skull is placed on a white surface, possibly a table. The crack in the skull is located on the left side of the skull.
There are two arrows pointing towards the crack in the skull. One arrow is located on the left side of the skull, and the other arrow is on the right side of the skull. These arrows indicate the direction of the crack in the skull.
In addition to the skull and arrows, there is a word "Fix" written on the right side of the skull. This word suggests that the skull might be in need of repair or fixing due to the crack.

In the image, there is a blue triangle on a white background. The triangle has a height of 6 meters and a base of 4 meters. The angle of the triangle is approximately 45 degrees. The height of the triangle is represented by the number 6, and the base of the triangle is represented by the number 4. The angle of the triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the side opposite the angle is 4 meters, and the length of the other side is 6 meters. Therefore, the angle of the triangle is approximately 45 degrees.

The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, while the dermis is the middle layer that contains blood vessels, sweat glands, and hair follicles. The melanocytes are the cells responsible for producing melanin, which gives the skin its color.
The image also highlights the blood vessels, sweat glands, and hair follicles within the dermis. The blood vessels are responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients to the skin, while the sweat glands produce sweat to help regulate body temperature. The hair follicles are responsible for growing and maintaining the hair on the body.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the human body's skin and its various components, including the epidermis, dermis, melanocytes, blood vessels, sweat glands, and hair follicles.

The image displays a line graph showing the temperature of the earth's atmosphere over time. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis shows the temperature in degrees Celsius. The graph is divided into three sections: Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and Modern Warm Period.
In the Medieval Warm Period, which spans from 950 to 1250 AD, the temperature was relatively high, with an average of around 12 degrees Celsius. In the Little Ice Age, which lasted from 1600 to 1850 AD, the temperature was significantly lower, with an average of around 7 degrees Celsius. Finally, in the Modern Warm Period, which began in the late 20th century, the temperature has been steadily increasing, with an average of around 10 degrees Celsius.

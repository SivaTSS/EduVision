In the image, there is a close-up of a bunch of bananas in a plastic bag. The bananas appear to be ripe and ready to be eaten. There is also a close-up of a ripe banana on the right side of the image.
In addition to the bananas, there is a close-up of a rotten banana on the right side of the image. The rotten banana is placed next to the ripe banana, creating an interesting contrast between the two.

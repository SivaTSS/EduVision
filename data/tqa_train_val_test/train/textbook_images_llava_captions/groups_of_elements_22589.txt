In the image, there is a diagram illustrating Group 18, which consists of the noble gases. These gases include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon, and polonium. Each of these gases is represented by a balloon, with the balloons varying in size and color.
The diagram also features a light bulb, which is a common symbol for the noble gases due to their low reactivity and inability to form compounds with other elements. The light bulb serves as a visual representation of the noble gases in the context of the image.

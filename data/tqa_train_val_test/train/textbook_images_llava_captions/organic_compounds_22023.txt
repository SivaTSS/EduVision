In the image, there is a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is depicted as a green and white checkerboard pattern, with the green representing the phospholipids that make up the membrane. These phospholipids are essential for the proper functioning of the cell membrane, as they regulate the flow of ions and molecules in and out of the cell. The close-up view of the cell membrane highlights the intricate structure of the phospholipids and their role in maintaining the integrity of the cell.

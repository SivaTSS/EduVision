In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the concept of interference. The diagrams showcase the effects of interference on a waveform. The first diagram displays a waveform with an arrow pointing upwards, indicating an increase in amplitude. The second diagram shows a waveform with an arrow pointing downwards, signifying a decrease in amplitude.
In both diagrams, there is a line labeled "before interference" and another line labeled "during interference." These lines represent the state of the waveform before and after the interference occurs. The presence of these lines highlights the impact of interference on the waveform, demonstrating how it affects the amplitude of the signal.

In the image, there is a close-up of a person's hand holding a pair of blue-handled scissors. The scissors are positioned in such a way that they appear to be squeezing a steering wheel. Above the scissors, there is a caption that reads, "When you turn a steering wheel, it causes the steering column to turn a shorter distance but with a greater force." Below the scissors, there is another caption that reads, "The steering column turns a shorter distance but with a greater force."
In the background of the image, there is a car steering wheel, which is the object being squeezed by the scissors in the foreground.

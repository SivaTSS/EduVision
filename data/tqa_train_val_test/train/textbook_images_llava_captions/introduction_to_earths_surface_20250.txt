In the image, there is a large body of blue water with a few small ripples. Above the water, there is a graph showing the depth of the water. The graph indicates that the water is approximately 1200 feet deep.
In addition to the water and the graph, there are two people in the image. One person is located on the left side of the image, while the other person is on the right side. They seem to be enjoying their time near the water.

The image depicts a diagram of the human body, focusing on the kidneys and the urinary system. There are two kidneys, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the body. The kidneys are connected to the urinary system, which includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra. The ureters carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, and the urethra carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
In addition to the kidneys and the urinary system, the diagram also shows the nephrons, which are the functional units of the kidneys. The nephrons are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and reabsorbing essential nutrients back into the bloodstream.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the human body's kidneys, urinary system, and nephrons.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each showing a different perspective of a hanging wall. The diagrams are labeled as "Hanging Wall" and "Reverse Thrust Fault." The hanging wall diagrams depict the wall's structure, while the "Reverse Thrust Fault" diagrams show the opposite side of the wall's structure. The diagrams provide a clear understanding of the wall's composition and the forces acting upon it.

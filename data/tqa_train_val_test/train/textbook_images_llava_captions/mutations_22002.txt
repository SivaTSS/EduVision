The image depicts a series of diagrams illustrating the process of translocating a chromosome. The diagrams show the movement of the chromosome from one side of the cell to the other.
In the first diagram, the chromosome is located on the left side of the cell. In the second diagram, the chromosome has moved to the center of the cell. In the third diagram, the chromosome is on the right side of the cell, and in the fourth diagram, the chromosome is back on the left side of the cell.
These diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the process of translocating a chromosome within a cell.

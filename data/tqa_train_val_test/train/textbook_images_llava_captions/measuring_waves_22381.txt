In the image, there is a diagram showing the relationship between crest, amplitude, and wavelength. The crest is the highest point of a wave, while the amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive wave crests.
The diagram illustrates that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the square root of the amplitude. This means that as the amplitude increases, the wavelength decreases, and vice versa. The relationship between the crest, amplitude, and wavelength is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves and how they propagate through various mediums.

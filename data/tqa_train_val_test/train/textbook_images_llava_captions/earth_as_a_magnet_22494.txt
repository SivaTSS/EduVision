In the image, there is a globe of the Earth with a magnetic pole and a geographic pole. The magnetic pole is located at the top of the globe, while the geographic pole is located at the bottom. The magnetic pole is represented by a blue line, while the geographic pole is represented by a red line.
There are several arrows pointing in different directions, indicating the Earth's magnetic field. These arrows are scattered around the globe, with some closer to the magnetic pole and others further away. The image provides a clear visual representation of the Earth's magnetic and geographic poles, as well as the Earth's magnetic field.

In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of evaporation and condensation in the atmosphere. The first diagram, labeled "Sea Breeze," shows the flow of air from the ocean to the land. The second diagram, labeled "Land Breeze," shows the flow of air from the land to the ocean.
In both diagrams, there are arrows indicating the direction of the airflow. The arrows in the "Sea Breeze" diagram point from the ocean to the land, while the arrows in the "Land Breeze" diagram point from the land to the ocean.
The diagrams also include labels for the different stages of the process, such as "Cool," "Warm," and "Return." These labels indicate the temperature changes that occur during the evaporation and condensation process.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the airflow and temperature changes associated with evaporation and condensation in both the "Sea Breeze" and "Land Breeze" scenarios.

In the image, there are two celestial objects in the sky. The first object is a large, round planet, which appears to be the main focus of the scene. The second object is a smaller, more distant celestial body, which could be a moon or another planet. The two objects are positioned in the sky, with the larger planet taking up a significant portion of the frame. The smaller object is located towards the right side of the image, providing a sense of depth and scale to the scene.

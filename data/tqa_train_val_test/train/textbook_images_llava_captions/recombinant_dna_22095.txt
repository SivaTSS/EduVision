2. Bacteria: This segment represents the bacteria that cause infections.
3. Antibiotic resistance: This segment represents the development of resistance to antibiotics by bacteria.
4. Reproduction: This segment represents the reproduction and spread of resistant bacteria.
5. Treatment failure: This segment represents the failure of treatments due to antibiotic resistance.
6. Disease progression: This segment represents the progression of diseases caused by resistant bacteria.
7. Antibiotic discovery: This segment represents the discovery of new antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria.
8. Antibiotic development: This segment represents the development of new antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria.
9. Antibiotic use: This segment represents

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the structure of water molecules and hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The water molecule diagram is on the left side of the image, while the hydrogen and oxygen atoms diagram is on the right side.
In the water molecule diagram, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms are depicted as spheres, with the oxygen atom being larger than the hydrogen atom. The two hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom, forming a water molecule.
In the hydrogen and oxygen atoms diagram, the hydrogen atoms are depicted as smaller spheres, and the oxygen atom is larger than the hydrogen atoms. The two hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom, forming a water molecule.
Overall, the diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure and composition of water molecules and hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

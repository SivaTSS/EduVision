The image depicts a molecular model of an oxygen molecule. The oxygen molecule is composed of two oxygen atoms, which are connected by a double bond. The double bond is represented by a yellow line that connects the two oxygen atoms.
In addition to the oxygen molecule, there are several other molecules present in the image. These include a nitrogen molecule, a carbon dioxide molecule, a water molecule, and a methane molecule. Each of these molecules is represented by a different colored circle, with the nitrogen molecule being purple, the carbon dioxide molecule being green, the water molecule being blue, and the methane molecule being orange.

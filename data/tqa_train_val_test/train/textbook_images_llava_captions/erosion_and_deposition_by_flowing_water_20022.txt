In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of a waterfall's formation. The waterfall is depicted as a series of overhangs and collapses that eventually lead to the formation of the waterfall.
The diagram is divided into three main sections. The first section shows the process of the waterfall's formation, starting with the undercutting of the softer rock by erosion. The second section illustrates the formation of the plunge pool, which is created when the waterfall collapses. Finally, the third section shows the formation of the waterfall itself, with the fallen rocks forming the waterfall's base.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the waterfall's formation process, from the initial undercutting of the softer rock to the creation of the plunge pool and finally, the formation of the waterfall itself.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the process of upwelling. Upwelling is the process by which cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean rises to the surface. The diagram illustrates this process by showing the movement of water from the deep ocean to the surface.
In the image, the upwelling process is depicted through a series of arrows. The arrows indicate the movement of water from the deep ocean to the surface. The diagram also shows the presence of wind, which plays a crucial role in the upwelling process. The wind pushes the cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface, creating the upwelling phenomenon.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the upwelling process, highlighting the role of wind and the movement of water from the deep ocean to the surface.

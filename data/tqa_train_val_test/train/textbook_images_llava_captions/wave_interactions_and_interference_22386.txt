In the image, there is a black and white diagram showing the relationship between an angle of reflection and an angle of incidence. The angle of reflection is represented by a blue line, while the angle of incidence is depicted by a red line. The diagram illustrates that the angle of incidence is equal to the sum of the angle of reflection and the angle of incidence. This concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of light when it interacts with a surface, such as a mirror or a lens.

In the image, there is a graph showing the temperature and humidity of the air. The temperature is plotted on the x-axis, and the humidity is plotted on the y-axis. The graph shows that the temperature is decreasing, while the humidity is increasing. There is also a cloud in the upper left corner of the image.
In addition to the main graph, there is a smaller graph on the right side of the main graph. This smaller graph shows the temperature and humidity of the air at different altitudes. The altitude is plotted on the y-axis, and the temperature and humidity are plotted on the x-axis. The smaller graph shows that the temperature and humidity decrease as the altitude increases.

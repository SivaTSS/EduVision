In the image, there is a table with a list of different decibel levels, ranging from 15 to 30 decibels. Alongside each decibel level, there is a corresponding exposure time and permissible exposure time. For example, at 15 decibels, the permissible exposure time is 8 hours, while at 30 decibels, the permissible exposure time is only 4 minutes. The table is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the relationship between decibel levels, exposure times, and permissible exposure times.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is composed of two layers: an inner layer and an outer layer. The inner layer, also known as the cytoplasm, contains the cell's organelles, such as mitochondria, ribosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, the outer layer, also known as the plasma membrane, serves as a barrier between the cell and its surroundings, allowing for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and signaling molecules.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a human eye. The eye is divided into three sections: the cornea, the iris, and the lens. The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye, while the iris is the colored part that controls the amount of light entering the eye. The lens is located behind the iris and is responsible for focusing light onto the retina.
The image also shows a cross-sectional view of the eye, highlighting the different layers and structures within the eye. The cross-sectional view provides a clear understanding of the anatomy and functioning of the human eye.

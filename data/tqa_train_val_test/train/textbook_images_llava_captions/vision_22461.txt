In the image, there is a series of four diagrams illustrating the process of correcting nearsightedness (myopia). Each of the diagrams represents a different stage of the correction process.
In the first diagram, there is a cross-sectional view of the eye, showing the irregular shape of the cornea. In the second diagram, there is a cross-sectional view of the eye after the cornea has been reshaped to correct the myopia. In the third diagram, there is a cross-sectional view of the eye after a lens has been inserted to correct the myopia. Finally, in the fourth diagram, there is a cross-sectional view of the eye after both the cornea and the lens have been reshaped to correct the myopia.
These diagrams provide a clear understanding of the process involved in correcting nearsightedness, from the initial irregular shape of the cornea to the final reshaping of both the cornea and the lens.

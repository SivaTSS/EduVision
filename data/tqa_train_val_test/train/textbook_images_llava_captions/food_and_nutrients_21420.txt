In the image, there are two pictures displayed side by side. The left picture shows a close-up view of sliced almonds, while the right picture shows a close-up view of sliced salmon. The almonds are scattered throughout the image, with some in the foreground and others in the background. The salmon, on the other hand, is also sliced and can be seen in various parts of the image. The two pictures provide a contrast between the nutritional value and appearance of the two different food items.

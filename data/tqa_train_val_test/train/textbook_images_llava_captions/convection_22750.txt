In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of cool air over water and warm air over land. The diagrams show the movement of air currents, with arrows indicating the direction of the airflow.
The first diagram focuses on the process of cool air over water. The arrows show that the cool air flows from the land towards the water, creating a cooler environment near the water's surface. The second diagram illustrates the process of warm air over land. The arrows show that the warm air flows from the water towards the land, creating a warmer environment near the land's surface.
In both diagrams, numbers are used to indicate specific points in the process. For example, in the cool air over water diagram, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, while in the warm air over land diagram, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. These numbers likely represent different stages or points in the airflow process.

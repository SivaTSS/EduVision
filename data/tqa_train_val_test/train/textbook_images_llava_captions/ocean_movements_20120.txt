In the image, there is a large iceberg floating on top of a body of water. The iceberg appears to be melting, causing the water to become denser, colder, and saltier. As the iceberg continues to melt, it will release more salt into the water, further increasing the density and saltiness of the water. This process can lead to the formation of ice crystals in the water, which can then freeze and create more icebergs in the future. The image illustrates the impact of climate change on the polar seas and the potential consequences for marine life and the overall ecosystem.

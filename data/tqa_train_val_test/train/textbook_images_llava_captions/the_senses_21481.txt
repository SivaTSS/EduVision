In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the inner ear and how sound waves travel through it. The diagram shows the three main parts of the inner ear: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal, while the middle ear contains the eustachian tube and the ossicones. The inner ear contains the cochlea and the vestibular system.
The diagram also shows the process of sound waves traveling through the inner ear. The sound waves enter the outer ear, pass through the ear canal, and reach the eardrum. From there, the sound waves travel through the eustachian tube and into the middle ear, where they strike the ossicones. Finally, the sound waves reach the cochlea and the vestibular system, where they are translated into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.

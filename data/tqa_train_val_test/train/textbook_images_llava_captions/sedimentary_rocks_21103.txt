In the image, there is a large crack in the ground that resembles the Grand Canyon. The crack extends from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the image. The ground appears to be a mix of dirt and sand, giving the impression of a desert-like environment.
There are two people visible in the image, one located near the top left corner and the other near the top right corner. They seem to be observing the impressive crack in the ground. Additionally, there are two birds in the scene, one near the top left corner and the other near the top right corner, adding a touch of life to the otherwise barren landscape.

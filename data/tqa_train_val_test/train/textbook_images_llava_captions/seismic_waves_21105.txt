In the image, there is a purple line on a white background that represents the crest of a wave. The crest is the highest point of the wave, where the water is at its most elevated. The purple line extends from the left side of the image to the right side, showing the progression of the crest as it moves along the wave. The wave itself is not visible in the image, but the crest serves as a visual representation of the wave's shape and movement.

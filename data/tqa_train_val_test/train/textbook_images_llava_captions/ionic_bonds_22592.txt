In the image, there is a representation of a chemical reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). The sodium atom is on the left side of the image, while the chlorine atom is on the right side. The reaction is depicted through a series of arrows, indicating the movement of the atoms during the process.
In addition to the sodium and chlorine atoms, there are two other atoms present in the image. One is located near the center of the image, and the other is on the right side, closer to the chlorine atom. These additional atoms are not part of the chemical reaction between sodium and chlorine.

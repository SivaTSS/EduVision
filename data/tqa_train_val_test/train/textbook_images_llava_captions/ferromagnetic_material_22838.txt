In the image, there are two black and white diagrams side by side. The diagrams depict the process of magnetization before and after the magnetization process.
In the "before" diagram, there are multiple arrows pointing in various directions, indicating the unmagnetized state of the material. In the "after" diagram, the arrows are concentrated in the center of the image, representing the magnetized state of the material.
The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the transformation of the material from an unmagnetized state to a magnetized state.

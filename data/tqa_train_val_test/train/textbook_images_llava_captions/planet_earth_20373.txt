The image depicts a celestial equator, which is an imaginary line that divides the celestial sphere into two equal halves. The celestial equator intersects the Earth's equator at a 45-degree angle. Along the celestial equator, there are several points of interest, including the North Celestial Pole (NCP) and the South Celestial Pole (SCP). The NCP is the point in the sky that is directly above the Earth's North Pole, while the SCP is the point in the sky that is directly above the Earth's South Pole.
In addition to the NCP and SCP, the celestial equator also intersects the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun in the sky. The ecliptic is an imaginary line that represents the Sun's apparent motion along the celestial sphere. The intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic is known as the First Point of Aries, which marks the beginning of the zodiac.

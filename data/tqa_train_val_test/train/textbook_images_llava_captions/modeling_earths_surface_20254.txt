In the image, there is a blue globe of the Earth surrounded by a yellow square. The blue globe is located in the center of the image, while the yellow square is positioned around the globe. The yellow square is divided into four smaller squares, with one on the left side, one on the right side, one at the top, and one at the bottom of the image.
In addition to the blue globe and the yellow square, there is a map of the United States in the upper right corner of the image. This map is also divided into four smaller squares, with one on the left side, one on the right side, one at the top, and one at the bottom of the image.
The combination of the blue globe, the yellow square, and the map of the United States creates a visually interesting and informative image.

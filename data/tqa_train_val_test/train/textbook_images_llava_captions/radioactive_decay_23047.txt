In the image, there is a chart showing the relationship between paper, aluminum, and lead. The paper is on the left side of the chart, while the aluminum is on the right side. The lead is positioned between the paper and the aluminum.
The chart is divided into three sections. The first section is the paper, which occupies the left side of the chart. The second section is the aluminum, which occupies the right side of the chart. The third section is the lead, which is positioned between the paper and the aluminum.
Each section is labeled, with the paper labeled as "Paper," the aluminum labeled as "Aluminum," and the lead labeled as "Lead." The chart provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between these three materials.

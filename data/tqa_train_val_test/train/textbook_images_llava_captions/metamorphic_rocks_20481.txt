In the image, there are two main elements: a large rock and a mountain. The rock is located on the left side of the image, while the mountain takes up the majority of the right side. The mountain appears to be covered in snow, giving it a majestic appearance.
There is also a ruler present in the image, likely used to measure the size of the rock relative to the mountain. The ruler can be seen on the left side of the image, providing a sense of scale for the viewer.

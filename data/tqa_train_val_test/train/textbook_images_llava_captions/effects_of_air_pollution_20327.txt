In the image, there is a chart showing the normal range of acidity in water. The chart is divided into three sections, with the first section showing the range of acidity from 6.5 to 7.5, the second section showing the range of acidity from 7.5 to 8.5, and the third section showing the range of acidity from 8.5 to 9.5.
There is also a bar graph showing the normal range of pH in water. The bar graph is divided into three sections, with the first section showing the normal range of pH from 6.5 to 7.5, the second section showing the normal range of pH from 7.5 to 8.5, and the third section showing the normal range of pH from 8.5 to 9.5.
Additionally, there is a line graph showing the normal range of acidity in water. The line graph is divided into three sections, with the first section showing the normal range of acidity from 6.5 to 7.5, the second section showing the normal range of acidity from 7.5 to 8.5,

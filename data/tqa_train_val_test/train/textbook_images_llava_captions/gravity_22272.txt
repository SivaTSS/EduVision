In the image, there is a representation of the Earth in the center of a blue, curved surface. This curved surface is reminiscent of a black hole, giving the impression that the Earth is at the center of the universe.
In addition to the Earth, there are two other objects in the scene. One is a satellite, which is located on the left side of the image, and the other is a space shuttle, positioned on the right side of the image. Both the satellite and the space shuttle appear to be orbiting around the curved surface, adding to the sense of the Earth being at the center of the universe.

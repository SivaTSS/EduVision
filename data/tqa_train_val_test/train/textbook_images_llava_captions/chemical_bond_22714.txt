In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the structure of hydrogen and water molecules. The hydrogen molecule is shown on the left side of the image, and the water molecule is shown on the right side of the image.
The hydrogen molecule is composed of a proton and an electron, while the water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The diagrams show the protons and electrons in the hydrogen molecule and the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water molecule.
In the hydrogen molecule, the proton is located at the center of the molecule, and the electron is located outside of the molecule. In the water molecule, the hydrogen atoms are located on the left side of the molecule, and the oxygen atom is located on the right side of the molecule.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the structure and composition of hydrogen and water molecules.

The image shows a comparison between fossil fuel pollution levels and natural gas pollution levels. On the left side of the image, fossil fuel pollution levels are displayed in pounds per billion units of energy. On the right side of the image, natural gas pollution levels are displayed in the same units of energy.
There is a significant difference between the pollution levels of fossil fuels and natural gas. The fossil fuel pollution levels are much higher than the natural gas pollution levels. This indicates that natural gas is a cleaner and more environmentally friendly source of energy compared to fossil fuels.

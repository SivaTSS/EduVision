In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram is a close-up of a glass filled with water, while the second diagram is a close-up of a piece of paper. The paper appears to be related to hydrogen peroxide, as indicated by the presence of the word "hydrogen peroxide" on the paper. The glass and the paper are placed next to each other, creating an interesting juxtaposition between the two subjects.

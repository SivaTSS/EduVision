In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between time and acceleration. The x-axis represents the time in seconds, while the y-axis shows the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s^2).
There are four main points on the graph: positive acceleration, zero acceleration, negative acceleration, and time in seconds. The graph illustrates how the acceleration changes over time, with positive acceleration indicating an increase in speed, negative acceleration representing a decrease in speed, and zero acceleration signifying no change in speed.

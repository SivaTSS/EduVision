In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the concept of how a diffraction occurs. One of the diagrams shows a wave passing through a narrow opening, while the other shows a wave passing through a larger opening. The diagrams demonstrate that the size of the opening affects the diffraction of the wave. The smaller the opening, the larger the diffraction occurs, and vice versa. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the relationship between the size of the opening and the diffraction of the wave.

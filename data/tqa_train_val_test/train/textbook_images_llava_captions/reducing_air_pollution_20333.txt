In the image, there is a close-up view of a scrubber, which is a machine used for cleaning purposes. The scrubber consists of several parts, including a container, a pump, and a filter. The container holds the cleaning solution, while the pump is responsible for circulating the solution through the scrubber. The filter is used to remove any debris or impurities from the cleaning solution before it is pumped back into the container.
In addition to the main components of the scrubber, there is a bottle present in the image. The bottle is likely used to hold the cleaning solution, which is then pumped through the scrubber for effective cleaning.

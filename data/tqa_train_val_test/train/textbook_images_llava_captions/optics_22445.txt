In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the difference between reflection and incident rays. The reflection rays are shown on the left side of the image, while the incident rays are depicted on the right side.
The reflection rays represent the path of light when it reflects off a surface, while the incident rays show the path of light when it enters a surface. The diagrams are labeled "Reflected Rays" and "Incident Rays" to differentiate between the two types of rays.

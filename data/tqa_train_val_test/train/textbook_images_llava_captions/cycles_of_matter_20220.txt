The image depicts a deer walking through a grassy field, with a tree in the background. Above the deer, there is a cloud in the sky. The image also includes a diagram that explains the nitrogen cycle.
The nitrogen cycle consists of three main stages: nitrogen fixation, nitrogen assimilation, and nitrogen waste. Nitrogen fixation involves the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by plants. Nitrogen assimilation is the process by which plants take up nitrogen from the soil and convert it into amino acids, proteins, and other organic compounds. Finally, nitrogen waste occurs when organic matter decomposes, releasing nitrogen back into the soil.
In the image, the nitrogen fixation stage is represented by the deer walking through the grassy field. The nitrogen assimilation stage is represented by the tree in the background, which takes up nitrogen from the soil and converts it into organic compounds. The nitrogen waste stage is not directly represented in the image but is an essential part of the nitrogen

In the image, there is a close-up view of a leaf with the word "stomata" written above it. The stomata are small pores on the surface of the leaf that allow for the exchange of gases, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, between the plant and its environment. The leaf is green and appears to be a part of a larger plant.

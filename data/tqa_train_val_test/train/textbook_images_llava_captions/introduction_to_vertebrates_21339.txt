The image depicts a tree-like diagram that showcases the evolutionary history of various animals. The diagram is divided into different sections, each representing a specific group of animals.
In the leftmost section, there is a fish labeled as "Fish." In the middle section, there is a bird labeled as "Birds." In the rightmost section, there is an amphibian labeled as "Amphibians." Additionally, there is a reptile labeled as "Reptiles" in the middle section.
Below the tree-like diagram, there is a list of the number of mya (million years ago) for each group of animals. The list starts with "Fish" at 550 mya, followed by "Birds" at 150 mya, "Amphibians" at 365 mya, "Reptiles" at 300 mya, and finally "Mammals" at 150 mya.
Overall, the image provides a visual representation of the evolutionary history of various animal groups.

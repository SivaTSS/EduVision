In the image, there is a graph showing the time of day and the distance traveled. The x-axis represents the time of day, while the y-axis shows the distance traveled in kilometers.
There are several points on the graph, each representing a specific time of day and the corresponding distance traveled. For example, at 10 o'clock, the distance traveled is 10 kilometers. At 11 o'clock, the distance traveled is 11 kilometers, and so on.
In addition to the main graph, there is a smaller graph on the right side of the main graph. This smaller graph also shows the time of day on the x-axis and the distance traveled on the y-axis.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between time of day and distance traveled.

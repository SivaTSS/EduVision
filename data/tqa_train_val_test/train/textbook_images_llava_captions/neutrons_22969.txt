In the image, there is a representation of the atomic structure of the element nitrogen. Nitrogen is the seventh most abundant element in the universe and the most abundant element in the Earth's atmosphere. It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that makes up about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.
The atomic structure of nitrogen consists of seven protons, seven neutrons, and seven electrons. The protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, forming the nucleus, while the electrons are distributed around the nucleus in the electron cloud. The electrons are arranged in shells, with the first shell holding two electrons, the second shell holding eight electrons, the third shell holding 18 electrons, the fourth shell holding 32 electrons, and the fifth shell holding 48 electrons. The sixth and seventh shells hold 50 and 72 electrons, respectively.

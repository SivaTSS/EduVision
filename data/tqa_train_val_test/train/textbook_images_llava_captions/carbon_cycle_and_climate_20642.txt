The image depicts a graph showing the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from 1958 to 2014. The graph shows a steady increase in CO2 levels over the years, with a noticeable spike in the late 1990s. This increase in CO2 levels can be attributed to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. The graph serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing climate change and adopting sustainable practices to reduce our carbon footprint.

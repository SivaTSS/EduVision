The image depicts a cross-section of the Earth, showcasing the inner core, outer core, and mantle. The inner core is located at the center of the Earth and is primarily composed of iron and nickel. The outer core, which surrounds the inner core, is also composed of iron and nickel and is responsible for the Earth's magnetic field. The mantle, which makes up the majority of the Earth's volume, is primarily composed of rock and is responsible for the Earth's tectonic activity.
In addition to the cross-section of the Earth, the image also features a globe of the Earth, providing a more comprehensive view of the planet.

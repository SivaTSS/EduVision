In the image, there is a black and white representation of a waveform. The waveform consists of a series of peaks and troughs, with the peaks being higher than the troughs. The waveform appears to be a combination of a sine wave and a square wave. The sine wave has a smooth, continuous curve, while the square wave has a more jagged, step-like appearance.
The waveform is displayed on a white background, making it the main focus of the image. The combination of the sine wave and the square wave creates a visually interesting and complex representation of a waveform.

In the image, there is a comparison between a parent nucleus and a daughter nucleus. The parent nucleus is shown on the left side of the image, while the daughter nucleus is on the right side. The parent nucleus consists of a large number of blue and orange spheres, while the daughter nucleus consists of a smaller number of blue and orange spheres.
There is also a black arrow pointing from the parent nucleus to the daughter nucleus, indicating the process of the daughter nucleus being formed from the parent nucleus.

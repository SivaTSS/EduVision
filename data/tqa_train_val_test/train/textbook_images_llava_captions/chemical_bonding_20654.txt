In the image, there is a three-dimensional representation of a water molecule. The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are positioned on the left and right sides of the molecule, while the oxygen atom is located in the middle. The molecule is depicted as a red, white, and blue structure, with the red and white colors representing the hydrogen atoms and the blue color representing the oxygen atom. The three-dimensional representation provides a clear visualization of the water molecule's structure and composition.

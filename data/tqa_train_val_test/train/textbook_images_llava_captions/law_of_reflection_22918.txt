In the image, there is a diagram depicting an incident ray, a reflected ray, and an angle of reflection. The incident ray is coming from the left side of the image, while the reflected ray is coming from the right side of the image. The angle of reflection is shown as an angle between the incident ray and the reflected ray.
The diagram also shows the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. The angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and a line perpendicular to the reflecting surface. The angle of reflection is the angle between the reflected ray and a line perpendicular to the reflecting surface.
Overall, the diagram provides a visual representation of the relationship between the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the angles of incidence and reflection.

This is a diagram of a molecule. The molecule is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The carbon atoms are arranged in a chain, forming the backbone of the molecule. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms, forming various functional groups. These functional groups give the molecule its unique properties, such as solubility, reactivity, and biological activity. The diagram shows the three-dimensional structure of the molecule, with the carbon atoms represented by black lines and the hydrogen and oxygen atoms represented by white lines. The molecule is also labeled with its chemical formula, indicating the number of atoms of each element present in the molecule.

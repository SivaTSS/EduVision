In the image, there is a line graph showing the production of various liquids and gases over time. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis shows the production of the liquids and gases.
There are several liquids and gases plotted on the graph, including water, oil, and natural gas. The production of these liquids and gases has increased significantly over the years, indicating a growing demand for these resources.
In addition to the liquids and gases, the graph also shows the total production of these resources, as well as the amount of water used for hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to extract these resources. This information provides a comprehensive overview of the production and usage of these resources over time.

The image depicts a cross-section of the Earth's atmosphere, ocean, and lithosphere. The lithosphere, which is the solid outer layer of the Earth, extends from the surface to a depth of approximately 29 kilometers. The ocean, which is the vast expanse of saltwater that covers most of the Earth's surface, extends from the lithosphere to a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. The atmosphere, which is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth, extends from the ocean to a height of approximately 10 kilometers.
In the image, a tree is depicted growing in the lithosphere, with its roots extending into the ocean and its leaves extending into the atmosphere. The tree serves as a visual representation of the interconnectedness of the Earth's various layers.

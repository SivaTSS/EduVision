In the image, there is a drawing of an area that is divided into three sections. The first section is labeled "Area 1," the second section is labeled "Area 2," and the third section is labeled "Area 3." Each section is further divided into smaller areas, creating a total of nine smaller areas. The drawing also includes a ruler, which is used to measure distances within the area. The ruler extends from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the drawing, allowing for precise measurements of the distances between the smaller areas.

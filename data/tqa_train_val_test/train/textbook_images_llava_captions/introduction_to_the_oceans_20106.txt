The image depicts a diagram illustrating the exchange of gases between oceans and the atmosphere. The main focus is on the relationship between sunlight, water vapor, clouds, and carbon dioxide.
In the diagram, the sun is positioned at the top, with water vapor, clouds, and carbon dioxide arranged around it. The sun's rays cause the water vapor in the atmosphere to condense and form clouds. These clouds, in turn, release water vapor back into the atmosphere, creating a continuous exchange of gases between the oceans and the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is also present in the diagram, indicating its role in the exchange process.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between sunlight, water vapor, clouds, and carbon dioxide in the context of the exchange between oceans and the atmosphere.

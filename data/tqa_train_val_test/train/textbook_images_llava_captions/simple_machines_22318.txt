In the image, there are two different views of a wooden door. The first view shows a close-up of the door, while the second view provides a broader perspective of the same door.
In the close-up view, a pair of scissors can be seen on the left side of the door. In the broader view, the scissors are positioned more towards the center of the door.
Additionally, there is a pair of scissors on the right side of the door in the broader view, which is not visible in the close-up view. The scissors in the broader view appear to be larger than those in the close-up view.

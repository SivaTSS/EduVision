This is a diagram of a molecule. The molecule is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are connected to the oxygen atoms by a chain of carbon atoms. The molecule is shaped like a diamond, with the hydrogen and oxygen atoms arranged in a three-dimensional structure. The hydrogen atoms are on the outside of the diamond, while the oxygen atoms are on the inside. This molecule is an example of a hydrocarbon, which is a type of organic compound made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons are found in many natural resources, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal. They are also used in the production of many everyday products, such as gasoline, plastics, and synthetic fibers.

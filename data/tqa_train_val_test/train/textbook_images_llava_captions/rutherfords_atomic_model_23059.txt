The image depicts a three-dimensional model of an atom, showcasing the protons, electrons, and neutrons. The protons are located at the center of the atom, while the electrons and neutrons are dispersed throughout the model. The electrons are positioned at various distances from the protons, with some closer to the center and others further away. The neutrons, on the other hand, are scattered throughout the model, with some closer to the protons and others farther away. The model provides a visual representation of the structure and composition of an atom.

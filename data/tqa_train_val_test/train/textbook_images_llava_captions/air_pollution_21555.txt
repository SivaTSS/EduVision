In the image, there are two maps displayed side by side. The first map shows the Arctic region with a large amount of ice, while the second map shows the same area with a significant reduction in ice. The reduction in ice can be attributed to climate change and global warming, which has led to the melting of the ice in the Arctic region.
The first map shows the extent of the ice, while the second map highlights the loss of ice in the same area. This comparison emphasizes the impact of climate change on the environment and the need for urgent action to mitigate its effects. The maps serve as a visual representation of the devastating consequences of global warming on the Arctic ecosystem.

In the image, there is a black and white diagram illustrating the concept of endothermic reaction. The diagram consists of a series of arrows pointing upwards and downwards, indicating the flow of energy in the reaction. The arrows are labeled with the words "energy absorbed" and "energy released," indicating the direction of the energy flow.
In addition to the arrows, there are several labels on the diagram, such as "products," "energy absorbed," "energy released," and "direction of reaction." These labels help to provide a clear understanding of the endothermic reaction process.
Overall, the image effectively conveys the concept of endothermic reaction through the use of arrows, labels, and diagrams.

In the image, there is a large green tractor parked in a field. The tractor is equipped with a large grain bin on the back, ready to be filled with grain. There are two people standing near the tractor, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the tractor.
In addition to the tractor, there are two trucks in the scene. One truck is parked on the left side of the tractor, and the other truck is parked on the right side of the tractor. The trucks are likely used for transporting the grain once it has been collected from the field.

The table starts with hydrogen (H) on the left side and ends with uranium (U) on the right side. In between, there are various elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), iron (Fe), and gold (Au), among others.
The periodic table is a useful tool for scientists and researchers to understand the properties and behavior of different elements in the periodic table.

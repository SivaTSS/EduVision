The Electromagnetic Spectrum is a visual representation of the various types of electromagnetic waves that exist in the universe. These waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave has a unique frequency and wavelength, which determines its properties and how it interacts with matter.
In the image, the Electromagnetic Spectrum is depicted as a colorful line, with each type of wave represented by a different color. The line starts with radio waves on the left, followed by microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays on the right. Each section of the line is labeled with the name of the corresponding type of electromagnetic wave, providing a clear visual representation of the entire spectrum.

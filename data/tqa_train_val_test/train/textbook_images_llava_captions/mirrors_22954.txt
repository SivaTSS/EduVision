In the image, there is a visual representation of a convex mirror. The mirror is described as a "convex mirror" in the top left corner of the image. The mirror is placed in the center of the image, surrounded by several arrows pointing in different directions. These arrows are likely used to illustrate the mirror's curvature and how it reflects objects differently than a flat mirror. The image provides a clear understanding of the mirror's properties and how it affects the perception of objects in its reflection.

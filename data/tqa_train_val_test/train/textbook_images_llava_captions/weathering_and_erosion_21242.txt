In the image, there is a pothole in the middle of the road with a black shoe sitting on top of it. The pothole appears to be filled with muddy water, and the shoe is resting on the edge of the pothole. The scene is set on a street with a crosswalk nearby. The presence of the shoe in the pothole suggests that someone might have accidentally dropped it there, or it could have been intentionally placed there as a form of protest or artistic expression.

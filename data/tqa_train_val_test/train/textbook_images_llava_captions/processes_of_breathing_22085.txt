In the image, there is an illustration of the human body, specifically focusing on the lungs and blood vessels. The lungs are depicted on the left side of the image, while the blood vessels are shown on the right side.
There are two main blood vessels in the illustration: the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein. The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the rest of the body, while the pulmonary vein carries oxygen-poor blood from the rest of the body to the lungs.
In addition to the main blood vessels, there are several smaller blood vessels scattered throughout the illustration, highlighting the intricate network of blood vessels in the human body.

This is a black and white image of a DNA sequence. The DNA sequence consists of 18 pairs of chromosomes. Each pair of chromosomes is labeled with a number from 1 to 18. The chromosomes are lined up in a row, with each pair of chromosomes separated by a line. The image is a close-up of the DNA sequence, allowing for a detailed view of the individual pairs of chromosomes.

In the image, there is a colorful bar graph illustrating the source of noise. The bar graph is divided into five sections, each representing a different source of noise. The sections are labeled as follows:
1. Moderate
2. Very Loud
3. Extremely Loud
4. Painfully Loud
5. Source of Noise
The bar graph provides a visual representation of the loudness levels associated with each source of noise, making it easier to understand and interpret the data.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a coconut on a map of the world. The coconut is cut in half, revealing its insides. The map is divided into several sections, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.
In addition to the coconut, there are several other elements on the map, such as the equator, the prime meridian, the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn, and the Arctic Circle. These elements provide context for the coconut's location on the globe.

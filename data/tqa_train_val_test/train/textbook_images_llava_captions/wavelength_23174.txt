In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each representing a different wave length. The diagrams are labeled "Wavelength" and show the relationship between the wavelength and the height of the wave.
In the first diagram, the wavelength is represented by the vertical axis, while the height of the wave is shown on the horizontal axis. In the second diagram, the height of the wave is represented by the vertical axis, while the wavelength is shown on the horizontal axis.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the relationship between the wavelength and the height of a wave, allowing for a better understanding of the concept.

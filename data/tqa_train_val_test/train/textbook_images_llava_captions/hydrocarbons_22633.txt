The image shows the chemical structure of ethene (C2H4) and ethane (C2H6). The ethene molecule has two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms, while the ethane molecule has three carbon atoms and three hydrogen atoms. The ethene molecule has a double bond between the two carbon atoms, while the ethane molecule has a single bond between the three carbon atoms.
In the image, the ethene molecule is shown on the left side, while the ethane molecule is shown on the right side. The double bond in the ethene molecule is represented by a line connecting the two carbon atoms, while the single bond in the ethane molecule is represented by a line connecting the three carbon atoms.

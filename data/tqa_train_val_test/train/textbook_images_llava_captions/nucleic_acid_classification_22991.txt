In the image, there is an illustration of a molecule called Nucleotide. The Nucleotide molecule is composed of three main parts: a nitrogen base, a sugar, and a phosphate group. The nitrogen base can be either adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil. The sugar can be either deoxyribose or ribose, and the phosphate group is composed of a phosphate and a phosphate ester.
In the illustration, the Nucleotide molecule is depicted as a three-dimensional structure, with the nitrogen base, sugar, and phosphate group represented in different colors. The nitrogen base is blue, the sugar is orange, and the phosphate group is green. The illustration provides a clear visual representation of the Nucleotide molecule and its components.

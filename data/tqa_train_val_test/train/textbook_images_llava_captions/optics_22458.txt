In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of cladding. The diagram consists of three main components: cladding, core, and sheathing. Cladding refers to the outer layer of the structure, which is typically made of materials such as wood, metal, or concrete. The core is the central part of the structure, which provides support and insulation. Sheathing, on the other hand, refers to the inner layer of the structure, which is responsible for protecting the core from moisture, wind, and other external elements.
The diagram shows the progression of the cladding process, starting with the sheathing, followed by the core, and finally ending with the cladding. This illustration provides a clear understanding of the various components involved in the cladding process and their respective roles in ensuring the structural integrity and insulation of a building.

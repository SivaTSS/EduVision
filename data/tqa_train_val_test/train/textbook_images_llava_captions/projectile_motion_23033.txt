In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between actual projectile motion and due to gravity alone. The x-axis represents the actual projectile motion, while the y-axis represents the due to gravity alone. The graph shows that the actual projectile motion is higher than the due to gravity alone.
There are three dots on the graph, with one on the left side, one in the middle, and one on the right side. These dots likely represent specific points on the graph, showing the relationship between the actual projectile motion and the due to gravity alone at those points.

The image depicts a diagram of the human respiratory system, focusing on the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract includes the nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx, while the lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.
In the upper respiratory tract, the nasal cavity is located above the pharynx, and the larynx is positioned above the trachea. The pharynx is situated between the nasal cavity and the larynx, and the trachea runs down from the larynx to the bronchi.
The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The trachea connects the larynx to the bronchi, and the bronchi lead to the bronchioles, which are the smallest air passages in the lungs.

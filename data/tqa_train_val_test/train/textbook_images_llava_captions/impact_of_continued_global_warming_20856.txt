In the image, there are two side-by-side graphs showing the thickness of sea ice over a 10-year period. The graphs display the average thickness of the sea ice in units of centimeters. The graphs show that the thickness of the sea ice has been steadily decreasing over the past decade.
In addition to the graphs, there is a globe in the image, which provides a visual representation of the Earth. The globe is located near the top left corner of the image. The combination of the graphs and the globe provides a comprehensive view of the Earth's sea ice thickness over a 10-year period.

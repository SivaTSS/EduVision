In the image, there is an illustration of a refrigerator's workings. The refrigerator is depicted as a series of interconnected tubes, with each tube representing a different stage of the refrigeration process.
The refrigerator is divided into three main sections: the compressor, the condenser, and the evaporator. The compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant, while the condenser is responsible for cooling the refrigerant. The evaporator, on the other hand, is responsible for evaporating the refrigerant.
In addition to these three main sections, the refrigerator also contains a thermostat, which controls the temperature inside the refrigerator. The thermostat ensures that the refrigerator maintains a consistent temperature, preventing the refrigerant from overheating or freezing.
Overall, the illustration provides a clear and concise overview of the refrigerator's workings, highlighting the key components and processes involved in the refrigeration process.

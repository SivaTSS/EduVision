In the image, there is a close-up view of a moon with a yellow triangle and a blue half-circle on it. The yellow triangle is located on the left side of the moon, while the blue half-circle is on the right side. The blue half-circle is slightly larger than the yellow triangle. The moon appears to be the main focus of the image, with the triangle and half-circle being the main points of interest.

In the image, there is a line graph showing the relationship between plastic region and elastic region. The x-axis represents the plastic region, while the y-axis represents the elastic region. The line on the graph indicates the transition from the plastic region to the elastic region.
There is also a red dot on the graph, which might represent a specific point of interest, such as a breakpoint or a critical point in the relationship between the two regions. Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between the plastic region and the elastic region.

In the image, there is a large globe of the Earth hanging from a rope. The globe is suspended in mid-air, and it appears to be the main focus of the scene. The rope holding the globe is positioned at the top left corner of the image.
In addition to the hanging globe, there are two arrows present in the scene. One arrow is located at the top right corner of the image, while the other arrow is positioned at the bottom right corner. These arrows might be used to indicate directions or points of interest on the globe.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum is a visual representation of the various types of electromagnetic waves that exist in the universe. These waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave has a unique frequency and wavelength.
In the image, the Electromagnetic Spectrum is depicted as a wavy line, with each type of wave represented by a different color. For example, radio waves are blue, microwaves are green, infrared is red, visible light is yellow, ultraviolet is violet, X-rays are orange, and gamma rays are purple.
In addition to the Electromagnetic Spectrum, the image also includes a diagram of a microwave oven, which is a common household appliance that utilizes microwaves to heat or cook food.

In the image, there is a turtle laying on top of a green mesh net. The turtle is positioned in the middle of the net, and it appears to be resting comfortably. The turtle's body is partially covered by the mesh net, giving the impression that it is wrapped up in the netting. The turtle seems to be enjoying its time on the net, possibly finding it a cozy spot to rest or observe its surroundings.

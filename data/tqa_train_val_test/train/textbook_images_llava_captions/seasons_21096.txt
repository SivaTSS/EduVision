In the image, there is a representation of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The Earth is depicted as a small dot on the left side of the image, while the Sun is positioned towards the top right corner of the image. The Earth's orbit is shown as a circular path, with the Earth moving in a counterclockwise direction.
Additionally, there are two other celestial bodies visible in the image. One is located towards the top left corner of the image, and the other is positioned towards the top right corner. These celestial bodies might be planets, moons, or other celestial objects, but their specific identities cannot be determined from the image alone.

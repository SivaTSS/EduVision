The image depicts a graph showing the global land-ocean temperature index from 1880 to 2012. The temperature index is plotted on the y-axis, and the years are plotted on the x-axis. The graph shows a clear upward trend in the temperature index over the years, indicating an increase in global temperatures.
In addition to the main temperature index line, there are two smaller lines on the graph. One of these lines represents the 5-year running mean, which smooths out the fluctuations in the temperature index over time. The other line represents the 5-year running mean of the temperature index, which also smooths out the fluctuations in the temperature index over time.
Overall, the graph provides a clear visual representation of the global land-ocean temperature index over the past century and a half, highlighting the increasing trend in global temperatures.

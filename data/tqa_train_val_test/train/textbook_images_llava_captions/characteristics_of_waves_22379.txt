In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first one is a graphic representation of ocean waves, showing the depth of the water and the height of the waves. The second one is a textual description of the same ocean waves, providing more detailed information about the wave patterns.
The graphic representation of the ocean waves shows the depth of the water and the height of the waves at various points along the shoreline. The textual description of the ocean waves provides more detailed information about the wave patterns, such as the size of the waves, the frequency of the waves, and the direction of the waves.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive understanding of the ocean waves and their impact on the shoreline. The combination of the graphic representation and the textual description allows for a more in-depth analysis of the wave patterns and their effects on the surrounding environment.

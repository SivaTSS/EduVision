The image shows a diagram of a refrigerator and how it works. The refrigerator is divided into three sections: the evaporator, the compressor, and the condenser. The evaporator is located at the top of the refrigerator and is responsible for absorbing heat from the surrounding air. The compressor is located at the bottom of the refrigerator and is responsible for compressing the refrigerant gas. The condenser is also located at the bottom of the refrigerator and is responsible for releasing the heat absorbed by the refrigerant back into the surrounding air. The refrigerator works by circulating the refrigerant between the evaporator, the compressor, and the condenser to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the process of transcribing DNA into RNA. The process starts with the double helix structure of DNA, which is composed of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These nucleotides are arranged in a specific sequence to form the DNA molecule.
The transcription process involves the use of an enzyme called RNA polymerase, which reads the DNA sequence and uses it to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule. The RNA polymerase moves along the DNA strand, adding one nucleotide at a time to the growing RNA chain.
The resulting RNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of proteins, which are essential for the proper functioning of the cell. The process of transcribing DNA into RNA is crucial for the survival and growth of living organisms.

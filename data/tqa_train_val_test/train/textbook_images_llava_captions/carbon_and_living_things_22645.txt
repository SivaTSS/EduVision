The image depicts a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is composed of two layers: a phospholipid bilayer and a hydrophobic core. The phospholipid bilayer is made up of phospholipids, which have a polar head and a non-polar tail. The hydrophobic core is composed of fatty acids, which are non-polar and do not interact with water. The phospholipid bilayer is responsible for the selective permeability of the cell membrane, allowing certain substances to pass through while preventing others from entering. The image also includes a diagram showing the layers of the cell membrane, with the phospholipid bilayer and the hydrophobic core labeled.

Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei combine to form a new, heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be harnessed to generate electricity. In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of nuclear fusion. One of the diagrams shows the fusion of two hydrogen atoms into a helium atom, while the other shows the fusion of two deuterium atoms into a helium-3 atom. Both diagrams depict the energy released during the fusion process, with the helium-3 fusion releasing more energy than the helium fusion.

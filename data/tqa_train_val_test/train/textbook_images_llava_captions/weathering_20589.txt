In the image, there is a close-up view of a rock with a large crack in it. The crack is filled with water, and it appears to be freezing. The water is expanding as it freezes, causing the crack to widen about 9% in volume, which is quite a significant amount. The close-up view of the rock and the water in the crack provides a detailed look at the process of freezing and its effects on the rock's structure.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the protons, neutrons, and electrons of an atom. The diagrams are placed side by side, with one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image.
In the diagrams, the protons are represented by red dots, the neutrons by green dots, and the electrons by blue dots. These dots are scattered throughout the diagrams, indicating the distribution of protons, neutrons, and electrons within the atoms. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure and composition of an atom.

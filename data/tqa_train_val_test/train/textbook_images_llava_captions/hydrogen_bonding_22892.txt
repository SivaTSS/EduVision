The image depicts a molecular model of a water molecule bonded to a hydrogen bond. The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are connected to the oxygen atom by covalent bonds, forming a water molecule. The hydrogen atoms are also connected to each other by a covalent bond, forming a hydrogen bond.
In the image, the water molecule is represented by a blue circle, while the two hydrogen atoms are represented by green circles. The oxygen atom is represented by a red circle. The hydrogen bond is represented by a yellow line connecting the two hydrogen atoms.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of a water molecule bonded to a hydrogen bond.

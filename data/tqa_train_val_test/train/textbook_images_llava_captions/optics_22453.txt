In the image, a microscope is being used to view a small plane mirror. The mirror is placed on a glass slide, and the microscope's objective lens is positioned above the mirror. The microscope's eyepiece lens is located below the objective lens, allowing the viewer to see the magnified image of the mirror. The microscope's stage is adjusted to bring the image into focus, and the viewer can observe the details of the mirror through the microscope's eyepiece. This demonstrates the process of using a microscope to examine small objects, such as the plane mirror in the image.

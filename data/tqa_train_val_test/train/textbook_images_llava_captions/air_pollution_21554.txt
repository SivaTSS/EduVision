The image depicts a diagram explaining the greenhouse effect. The main focus is on the Earth's atmosphere and its relationship to the Earth's surface. The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the Earth's surface to warm up.
In the diagram, there is a representation of the Earth's surface and the atmosphere above it. The Earth's surface is depicted as a circle, while the atmosphere is shown as a series of concentric circles surrounding the Earth's surface. These circles represent the different layers of the atmosphere, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.
Additionally, there are arrows pointing towards the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, illustrating the flow of heat and energy between the two. This diagram provides a clear and concise explanation of the greenhouse effect and its impact on the Earth's climate.

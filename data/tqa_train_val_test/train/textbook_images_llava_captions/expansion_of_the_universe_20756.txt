In the image, there is a black and white diagram showing the different colors of the rainbow. The rainbow consists of seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each color is represented by an arrow pointing in the direction of the color. The arrows are lined up vertically, starting from the red color at the top and ending with the violet color at the bottom. This diagram provides a clear visual representation of the rainbow's colors and their order.

The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, focusing on the Yellowstone Caldera. The caldera is a large, depression-like feature in the Earth's crust, formed by a volcanic eruption.
In the image, there are several layers of the Earth's interior, including the mantle and the crust. The mantle is the layer beneath the crust, and the crust is the outermost layer of the Earth. The image also shows a cross-sectional view of the Earth's core, which is divided into the outer core and the inner core. The outer core is primarily composed of liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and composed of the same materials.
Additionally, the image shows the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core. The Earth's magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting the planet from the harmful effects of solar radiation and maintaining the Earth's climate.

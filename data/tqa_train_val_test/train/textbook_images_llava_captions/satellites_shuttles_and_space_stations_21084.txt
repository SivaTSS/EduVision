In the image, a space shuttle is docked with a space station. The space shuttle is positioned above the space station, and the two are connected by a bridge. The space shuttle appears to be in the process of undocking from the space station.
There are two people visible in the image, one near the top left corner and the other near the top right corner. They seem to be observing the space shuttle as it undocks from the space station.

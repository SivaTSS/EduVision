In the image, there is a large rock sitting in the middle of a body of water, which appears to be a lake or a pond. The rock is surrounded by water, and it seems to be the focal point of the scene. The water appears to be murky, giving it a greenish hue. There are no other objects or people visible in the image, making the rock stand out as the main subject.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each depicting a molecule. The molecule on the left is labeled "Borane," while the molecule on the right is labeled "Lithium." The diagrams show the atoms that make up these molecules, with each atom represented by a dot. The atoms are connected by lines, indicating the bonds between them. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure and composition of these molecules.

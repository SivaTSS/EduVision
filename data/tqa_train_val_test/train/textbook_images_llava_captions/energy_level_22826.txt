In the image, there is a diagram showing the energy levels of an atom. The energy levels are labeled as I, II, III, IV, V, and VI. There is a green dot in the center of the diagram, which represents the nucleus of the atom. The energy levels surrounding the nucleus are labeled as I, II, III, IV, V, and VI. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the energy levels within an atom.

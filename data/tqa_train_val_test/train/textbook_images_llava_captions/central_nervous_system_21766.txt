In the image, there are two side-by-side images of a human brain. The first image is on the left side, and the second image is on the right side. Both images show a close-up view of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain.
The cerebral cortex is divided into various regions, such as the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe. These regions are responsible for different functions, such as motor control, sensory processing, and cognitive functions.
The close-up view of the cerebral cortex highlights the intricate network of neurons and blood vessels that make up this vital part of the brain.

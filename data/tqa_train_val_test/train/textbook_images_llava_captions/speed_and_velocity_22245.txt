In the image, a woman is pitching a softball on a field. She is wearing a maroon shirt and is in the process of throwing the ball. The sports ball can be seen in the air, close to the pitcher's hand.
There are two sports balls in the scene, one near the pitcher and the other further away. A baseball glove is visible on the right side of the image, likely belonging to the pitcher or another player on the field.

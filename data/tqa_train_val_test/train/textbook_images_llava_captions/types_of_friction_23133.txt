In the image, there is a close-up view of a ball bearing in a wheel. The ball bearing is located in the center of the wheel, and it is surrounded by several other smaller balls. These smaller balls are positioned around the outer edge of the wheel, with some located closer to the top and others near the bottom of the wheel. The arrangement of these balls helps to distribute the weight of the wheel evenly, ensuring smooth and efficient rotation.

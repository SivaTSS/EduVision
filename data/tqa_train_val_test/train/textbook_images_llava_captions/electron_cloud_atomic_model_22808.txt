In the image, there are four red and blue spheres arranged in a square formation. Each of the spheres is labeled with a letter and a number, indicating their position in the arrangement. The spheres are positioned at the corners of the square, with one at the top left, one at the top right, one at the bottom left, and one at the bottom right. The arrangement creates a visually appealing and organized display of the spheres.

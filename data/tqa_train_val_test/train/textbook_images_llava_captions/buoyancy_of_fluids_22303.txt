In the image, there is a flowchart showing the process of a boat floating on water. The flowchart consists of three main elements: a boat, a sink, and a buoyant force. The boat is located on the left side of the flowchart, while the sink is positioned on the right side. The buoyant force is depicted as a line connecting the boat and the sink, indicating the force that keeps the boat afloat in the water. The flowchart provides a visual representation of the relationship between the boat, the sink, and the buoyant force in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

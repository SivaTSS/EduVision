In the image, there is a chemical reaction taking place between water and oxygen. The oxygen molecule (O2) reacts with the water molecule (H2O) to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This reaction is represented by a series of arrows connecting the water molecule, the oxygen molecule, and the hydrogen peroxide molecule.
In addition to the hydrogen peroxide molecule, there is also a water molecule and an oxygen molecule present in the image. The water molecule is located on the left side of the image, while the oxygen molecule is located on the right side. The hydrogen peroxide molecule is situated in the middle of the image, connecting the water molecule and the oxygen molecule.

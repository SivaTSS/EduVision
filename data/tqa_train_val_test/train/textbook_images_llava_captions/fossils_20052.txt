In the image, there are four diagrams illustrating the life cycle of an ammonite fossil. The diagrams showcase the different stages of the ammonite's life, from its initial formation to its eventual burial and fossilization.
The first diagram shows the initial formation of the ammonite, with a spiral-shaped shell. The second diagram depicts the ammonite's growth and development, including the addition of chambers to the shell. The third diagram illustrates the ammonite's burial and fossilization process, as it sinks to the ocean floor. Finally, the fourth diagram displays the ammonite's transformation into a fossil, preserved for millions of years.
Each of the four diagrams is accompanied by a caption describing the specific stage of the ammonite's life cycle. Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the ammonite's life cycle, from its initial formation to its eventual preservation as a fossil.

The image depicts a ground-level ozone formation process. It shows the formation of ozone from nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight.
In the image, there are three main components: sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sunlight acts as a catalyst, causing a chemical reaction between the NOx and VOCs, resulting in the formation of ozone.
Several molecules can be seen in the image, including ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The ozone molecule is located towards the right side of the image, while the nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are dispersed throughout the scene.
Overall, the image provides a visual representation of the ground-level ozone formation process, highlighting the role of sunlight, NOx, and VOCs in the formation of ozone.

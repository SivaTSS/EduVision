The image depicts a high voltage power supply with a positive plate and a negative plate. The positive plate is located on the left side of the image, while the negative plate is situated on the right side. The high voltage power supply is connected to the positive plate and the negative plate, creating an electrical circuit.
In addition to the power supply, there is a transformer in the scene. The transformer can be seen on the left side of the image, close to the positive plate. This transformer is likely used to step up or step down the voltage in the electrical circuit.
Overall, the image showcases an electrical system with a high voltage power supply, a positive plate, a negative plate, and a transformer, all working together to generate and distribute electricity.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a human eye, showing the retina and optic nerve. Alongside the eye, there is a diagram illustrating the optic nerve and retina. The optic nerve is depicted as a long, thin line extending from the eye to the brain, while the retina is shown as a layer of tissue at the back of the eye.
In addition to the eye and optic nerve diagrams, there are two arrows in the image. One arrow is pointing towards the optic nerve, and the other arrow is pointing towards the retina. These arrows help to emphasize the relationship between the eye, optic nerve, and retina.

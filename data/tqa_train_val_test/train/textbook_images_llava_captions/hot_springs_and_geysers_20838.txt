The image depicts a breathtaking scene of a geyser erupting in the middle of a forest. The geyser spews water and smoke high into the air, creating a captivating spectacle.
In addition to the geyser, there are two rainbows visible in the scene. One rainbow is located on the left side of the image, while the other is on the right side. These rainbows add a touch of color and beauty to the otherwise dramatic landscape.

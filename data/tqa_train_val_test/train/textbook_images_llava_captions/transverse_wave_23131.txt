In the image, there is a graph showing the motion of a rock. The rock's motion can be described as a sine wave, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the rock's position. The rock's motion starts from the left side of the graph and moves towards the right side.
There are two orange arrows in the graph, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. These arrows indicate the direction of the rock's motion, with the upward arrow representing the rock's upward motion and the downward arrow representing the rock's downward motion.
Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the rock's motion as a sine wave, with the orange arrows indicating the direction of the rock's motion.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the process of a proton decaying into a neutron and an electron. The first diagram shows the proton decaying into a neutron and an electron, while the second diagram shows the proton decaying into a positron and an electron.
In the first diagram, the proton is located on the left side of the image, while the neutron and the electron are on the right side. The second diagram shows the proton on the left side, and the positron and the electron on the right side of the image.
In both diagrams, there is a yellow circle representing the proton, a red circle representing the neutron, and a blue circle representing the electron. Additionally, there is a black circle representing the positron in the second diagram.

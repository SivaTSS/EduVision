The image depicts a cross-section of the sun, showcasing its internal structure. The sun is divided into three main sections: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The core, which is the innermost part of the sun, is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The radiative zone, located between the core and the convective zone, is responsible for releasing the sun's energy through the process of nuclear fusion. The convective zone, the outermost part of the sun, is characterized by turbulent convective motion, which transports heat from the core to the outer layers of the sun.
In addition to these three main sections, the image also highlights the sun's surface, where the convective zone meets the photosphere. The photosphere is the outermost layer of the sun, and it is responsible for producing the sun's light and heat.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the sun's internal structure and the processes that occur within it.

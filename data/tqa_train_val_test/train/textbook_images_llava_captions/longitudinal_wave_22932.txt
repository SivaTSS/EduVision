In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the concept of a Longitudinal Wave in a Spring. The diagram is divided into three sections: Rarefaction, Compression, and Direction of Wave.
The Rarefaction section is located on the left side of the diagram, while the Compression section is situated on the right side. The Direction of Wave is depicted in the middle of the diagram, with the arrow pointing to the right.
In the Rarefaction section, there are two arrows, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. In the Compression section, there are two arrows as well, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. The arrows in the Direction of Wave section point in the same direction as the arrows in the Rarefaction and Compression sections.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the concept of a Longitudinal Wave in a Spring.

In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection for a P-wave shadow zone. The x-axis represents the angle of incidence in degrees, while the y-axis represents the angle of reflection in degrees.
The graph shows that as the angle of incidence increases, the angle of reflection decreases, and vice versa. The P-wave shadow zone occurs when the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, resulting in a horizontal line on the graph. This line represents the boundary between the shadow zone and the rest of the graph, where the angle of incidence is greater than the angle of reflection.
Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection in the context of the P-wave shadow zone.

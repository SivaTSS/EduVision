In the image, there is a representation of a chemical reaction involving oxygen and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with oxygen (O2) to form carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O). The reaction is depicted through a series of arrows, indicating the flow of reactants and products during the process.
There are three main components in the reaction: carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, there is a water molecule (H2O) present in the reaction, which is a byproduct of the process.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and oxygen, highlighting the formation of carbon monoxide and water.

This is a graph showing the effect of amylase enzyme on starch digestion rate. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the starch digestion rate. The graph shows that the starch digestion rate increases as the time increases. There is also a description of the effect of amylase enzyme on starch digestion rate without amylase. The graph shows that the starch digestion rate without amylase is significantly lower than with amylase.

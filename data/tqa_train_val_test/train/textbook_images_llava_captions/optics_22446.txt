In the image, there is a diagram showing the angles of incidence and reflection. The angles of incidence are labeled as "angle of incidence," while the angles of reflection are labeled as "angle of reflection." The diagram illustrates the relationship between the angles of incidence and reflection, as well as the concept of mirrors.
There are two mirrors in the image, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The angles of incidence and reflection are represented by arrows pointing towards and away from the mirrors, respectively. The angles of incidence and reflection are labeled as "angle of incidence" and "angle of reflection," respectively. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between the angles of incidence and reflection, as well as the concept of mirrors.

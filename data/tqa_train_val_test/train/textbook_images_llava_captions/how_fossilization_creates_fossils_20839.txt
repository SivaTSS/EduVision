In the image, there is a square divided into four smaller squares. Each of the smaller squares contains a different type of fossil, such as a dinosaur bone, a bird, a fish, and a mammal. The arrangement of the fossils in each of the smaller squares creates a visually appealing and informative representation of the different types of fossils found in the earth's crust.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram shows the chemical structure of Polyethylene, while the second diagram displays the chemical structure of Polypropylene. Both diagrams are in black and white.
Polyethylene is a thermoplastic polymer made from the polymerization of ethylene molecules. It is commonly used for packaging, plastic bags, and other consumer products. Polypropylene, on the other hand, is a thermoplastic polymer made from the polymerization of propylene molecules. It is used for a wide range of applications, including packaging, textiles, and automotive parts.

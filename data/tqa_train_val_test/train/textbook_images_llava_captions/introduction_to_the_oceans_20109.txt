In the image, there is a diagram showing the different zones of the ocean. These zones include the Intertidal Zone, the Neritic Zone, and the Aphotic Zone. The Intertidal Zone is the area between the high and low tides, where various organisms can be found. The Neritic Zone is the area between the low tide and the continental shelf, where the water is shallow. The Aphotic Zone is the deepest part of the ocean, where sunlight does not penetrate, and it is the coldest and darkest part of the ocean.
In addition to these zones, there is a diagram showing the different layers of the ocean, including the Photic Zone, the Mesopelagic Zone, and the Bathypelagic Zone. The Photic Zone is the area where sunlight can penetrate, and it is the warmest part of the ocean. The Mesopelagic Zone is the area between the Photic Zone and the Aphotic Zone, and the Bathypelagic Zone is the area between the Aphotic Zone and the Challenger Deep, which is the deepest part of the ocean.

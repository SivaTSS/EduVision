The image shows a side-by-side comparison of two different celestial objects. On the left side, there is a close-up view of the moon, while on the right side, there is a close-up view of a comet. The moon appears to be larger than the comet, as it occupies a larger portion of the image on the left side. The comet, on the other hand, is smaller and takes up a smaller portion of the image on the right side. The contrast between the two celestial objects highlights their differences in size and appearance.

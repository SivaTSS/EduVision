In the image, there is an illustration of a water table and a clay layer. The water table is located at the bottom of the image, while the clay layer is situated above the water table. The clay layer is described as a confined aquifer, which means that the water in the clay layer is under pressure.
The illustration also includes a cloud and a raindrop, suggesting that the water in the clay layer is recharged through rainfall. The cloud and raindrop are positioned above the clay layer, indicating the source of water for the aquifer.
Overall, the image depicts the relationship between the water table, the clay layer, and the rainfall that replenishes the water in the confined aquifer.

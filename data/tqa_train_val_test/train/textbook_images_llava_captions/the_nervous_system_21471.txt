The image shows a close-up view of the human brain. The brain is divided into several parts, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for most of the brain's functions, such as thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving. The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain and is responsible for coordinating movement and balance. The medulla oblongata is located at the base of the brain and is responsible for regulating the body's automatic functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.

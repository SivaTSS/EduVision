In the image, there is a group of construction workers standing in a muddy area in front of a building. The workers are wearing hard hats, and some of them are carrying backpacks. There are also a couple of trucks in the scene, one of which is parked closer to the workers, while the other is further away.
In addition to the workers and trucks, there are two refrigerators visible in the scene. One refrigerator is located closer to the left side of the image, while the other is positioned more towards the center. The muddy area appears to be a construction site, and the workers seem to be engaged in various tasks related to the ongoing project.

In the image, there is a family tree diagram that illustrates the relationships between parents and their children. The tree is divided into two sections, one for male children and the other for female children.
In the male section, there are three children: one at the top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom. In the female section, there are also three children: one at the top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom.
Each child is represented by a square, and the relationships between the parents and their children are indicated by arrows pointing from the parents to their respective children. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the family structure and relationships.

In the image, there is a diagram that illustrates the process of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis is depicted on the left side of the diagram, while cellular respiration is shown on the right side.
In the center of the diagram, there is a representation of a chloroplast, which plays a crucial role in the process of photosynthesis. The chloroplast is responsible for converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.
On the right side of the diagram, there is a representation of a mitochondrion, which is involved in cellular respiration. The mitochondrion is responsible for breaking down glucose and producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through the process of cellular respiration.
In addition to the chloroplast and mitochondrion, there are several other elements in the diagram, such as oxygen, glucose, carbon dioxide, and water. These elements are essential components of the process of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

The image depicts a solar radiation spectrum, illustrating the various wavelengths and intensities of the sun's radiation. The spectrum is divided into different sections, each representing a specific range of wavelengths.
In the image, there are three main sections: the ultraviolet (UV) section, the visible light section, and the infrared (IR) section. The UV section is located on the left side of the spectrum, while the visible light section spans from the center to the right side. The IR section is situated on the right side of the spectrum.
The visible light section is further subdivided into different colors, such as blue, green, yellow, and red. Each color represents a specific range of wavelengths within the visible light spectrum.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the solar radiation spectrum, highlighting the various wavelengths and intensities of the sun's radiation.

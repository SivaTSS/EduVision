In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each depicting a network of interconnected nodes. The diagrams are labeled A and B. The nodes in these diagrams are represented by circles, and the connections between the nodes are depicted by lines.
In the A diagram, there are numerous circles scattered throughout the network, and the lines connecting them form a dense web. The B diagram, on the other hand, has a more sparse arrangement of circles, with fewer lines connecting them.
A yellow arrow is pointing from the A diagram towards the B diagram, drawing attention to the differences between the two networks. Overall, the diagrams provide a visual representation of the interconnectedness and complexity of the networks.

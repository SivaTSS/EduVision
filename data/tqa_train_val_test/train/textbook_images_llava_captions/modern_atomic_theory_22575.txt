In the image, there is an illustration of the energy levels and electrons of magnesium (Mg). Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, such as muscle and nerve function, bone health, and maintaining a healthy immune system.
The energy levels and electrons of magnesium are depicted in the form of an electron dot diagram. The diagram shows that magnesium has two electrons in its outermost energy level, which is the second energy level from the top. The electrons are distributed around the nucleus, with one electron on the left side and the other electron on the right side of the nucleus.
This illustration provides a visual representation of the energy levels and electrons of magnesium, making it easier to understand the structure and behavior of this essential mineral.

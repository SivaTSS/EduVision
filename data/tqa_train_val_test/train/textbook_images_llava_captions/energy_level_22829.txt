In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the chemical reactions between hydrogen and fluorine. The diagrams are labeled with the names of the elements involved in the reactions, such as hydrogen and fluorine.
In the first diagram, there are two hydrogen atoms on the left side and one fluorine atom on the right side. In the second diagram, there are two hydrogen atoms on the right side and one fluorine atom on the left side.
Both diagrams show the progression of the reactions, with the hydrogen atoms combining with the fluorine atoms to form new compounds. The arrows in the diagrams indicate the movement of the atoms during the reactions. Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the chemical reactions between hydrogen and fluorine.

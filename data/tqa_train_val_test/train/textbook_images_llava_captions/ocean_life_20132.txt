The image depicts a food chain in the ocean, starting with the smallest fish and ending with the largest predator, the shark. The food chain consists of various fish species, such as the small fish, the fish larve, and the zooplankton. The zooplankton serves as the base of the food chain and is consumed by the fish larve, which in turn is eaten by the small fish. Finally, the shark is at the top of the food chain, feeding on the small fish and other predators in the ocean ecosystem.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is composed of two layers, the inner and outer membranes. The inner membrane, also known as the cytoplasm, contains the cell's organelles, such as mitochondria, ribosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The outer membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, serves as a barrier between the cell and its surroundings, allowing for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and signaling molecules.

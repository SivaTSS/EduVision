In the image, there is a pink, three-dimensional representation of an atom. The atom is composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, while the electrons are distributed around the outside of the atom. The protons and neutrons are labeled as positively charged particles, while the electrons are labeled as negatively charged particles.
In addition to the protons, neutrons, and electrons, the image also shows the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The atomic number of the atom in the image is 8, indicating that it has eight protons in its nucleus.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram shows the process of a chemical reaction, while the second diagram illustrates the process of an exothermic reaction.
In the chemical reaction diagram, there are three main components: reactants, products, and energy. The reactants are on the left side of the diagram, while the products are on the right side. The energy is represented by the arrow pointing upwards, indicating that energy is absorbed during the reaction.
In the exothermic reaction diagram, there are also three main components: reactants, products, and energy. The reactants are on the left side of the diagram, while the products are on the right side. The energy is represented by the arrow pointing downwards, indicating that energy is released during the reaction.
Both diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the processes involved in chemical and exothermic reactions.

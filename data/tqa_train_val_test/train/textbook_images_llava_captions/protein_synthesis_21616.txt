This is a diagram of a DNA molecule. The DNA molecule is composed of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These nucleotides are arranged in a specific sequence to form the DNA double helix. The double helix consists of two complementary strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds.
In the image, the DNA molecule is depicted as a spiral staircase, with each step representing one of the four nucleotides. The staircase is color-coded, with each color representing a specific nucleotide: purple for A, blue for C, green for G, and red for T. This color-coding makes it easier to visualize and understand the structure of the DNA molecule.

In the image, there is a large oil field with numerous oil wells. The oil wells are scattered throughout the field, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. There are also several power lines running through the field, providing electricity to the oil wells.
In addition to the oil wells and power lines, there are a couple of trucks visible in the scene. One truck is located near the left side of the image, while the other truck is situated closer to the right side. The presence of these trucks suggests that they might be used for transportation or maintenance purposes within the oil field.

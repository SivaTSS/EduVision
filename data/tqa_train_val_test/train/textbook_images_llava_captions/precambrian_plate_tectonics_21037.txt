Rodinia is a supercontinent that existed during the Neoproterozoic era, approximately 1.1 to 0.6 billion years ago. It was formed as a result of the collision of several smaller continents. The image depicts a map of the Rodinia supercontinent, showcasing its various regions.
The map is divided into different sections, each representing a specific region of the Rodinia supercontinent. These regions include the Antarctic Craton, the Australian Craton, the South China Craton, and the Siberian Craton. The Antarctic Craton is located at the bottom left of the map, while the Australian Craton spans across the middle of the map. The South China Craton is situated at the top right of the map, and the Siberian Craton is located at the top left of the map.
The Rodinia supercontinent was characterized by a diverse range of geological features, including volcanic activity, tectonic movements, and the formation of various minerals and rocks. This supercontinent played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's

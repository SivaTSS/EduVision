The image depicts a series of graphs illustrating the concept of interference. There are three graphs in total, each showing the effects of interference on a waveform. The graphs are labeled with the letters A, B, and C.
The first graph, labeled A, shows the waveform before interference. The second graph, labeled B, displays the waveform during interference. The third graph, labeled C, illustrates the waveform after interference.
In each graph, the waveform is represented by a series of peaks and valleys. The interference can be observed as distortions in the shape and spacing of these peaks and valleys. The graphs provide a clear visual representation of the impact of interference on a waveform.

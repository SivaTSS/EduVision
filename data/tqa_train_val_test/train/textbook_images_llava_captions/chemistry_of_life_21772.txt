In the image, there is a black and white illustration of an atomic model. The atomic model consists of three spheres, each with a different color: red, blue, and green. The red sphere is located on the left side of the model, the blue sphere is in the middle, and the green sphere is on the right side.
In addition to the three main spheres, there are two smaller spheres on the left side of the model. These smaller spheres are positioned between the red and blue spheres. Overall, the illustration provides a clear representation of an atomic model.

In the image, there is a blue and red graph showing the relationship between the length of a wave and its crest. The x-axis represents the length of the wave, while the y-axis represents the crest of the wave. The graph shows that as the length of the wave increases, the crest of the wave also increases.
In addition to the main graph, there are two smaller graphs on the right side of the main graph. One of the smaller graphs shows the relationship between the length of a wave and its trough, while the other smaller graph shows the relationship between the length of a wave and its crest. These smaller graphs help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the length of a wave and its various components.

This is a periodic table of elements. The table is divided into two sections, one for metals and the other for non-metals. The metals section is located on the left side of the table, while the non-metals section is on the right side. Each element is identified by its atomic number, symbol, and name.
In the metals section, the elements are arranged from left to right, starting with hydrogen (H) at the top left corner and ending with uranium (U) at the bottom right corner. In the non-metals section, the elements are arranged from left to right, starting with hydrogen (H) at the top left corner and ending with uranium (U) at the bottom right corner.
The table is color-coded, with the metals section being yellow and the non-metals section being pink. This color-coding makes it easier to distinguish between metals and non-metals.

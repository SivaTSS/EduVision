In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each representing a different molecule. The molecule on the left is labeled "Neon," while the one on the right is labeled "Nitrogen." The diagrams show the atoms that make up these molecules.
In the "Neon" diagram, the atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with the central atom surrounded by six other atoms. The atoms in the "Nitrogen" diagram are arranged in a tetrahedral pattern, with the central atom surrounded by four other atoms. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the molecular structures of these two gases.

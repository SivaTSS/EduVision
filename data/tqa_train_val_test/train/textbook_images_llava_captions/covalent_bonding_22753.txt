In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the structure of an oxygen molecule. The diagrams are placed side by side, with one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image.
The diagrams show the atoms that make up an oxygen molecule, including the two oxygen atoms and the four hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are represented by small circles, while the oxygen atoms are represented by larger circles. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the structure of an oxygen molecule.

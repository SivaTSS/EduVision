The image depicts a map of the Gulf of Mexico, showing the boundaries of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and the continental shelf. The EEZ is a 200-nautical-mile zone extending from the baseline of a country's coastline to the outer edge of the continental shelf. The continental shelf is the submerged part of a country's coastline that extends from the shoreline to a distance of 200 nautical miles or to the edge of the continental shelf, whichever is the greater distance.
In addition to the EEZ and the continental shelf, the map also shows the location of various cities and towns along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. These include cities such as New Orleans, Houston, and Tampa, as well as smaller towns and villages.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the Gulf of Mexico, highlighting the boundaries of the EEZ and the continental shelf, as well as the coastal cities and towns that surround this vast body of water.

In the image, there is a series of three diagrams displayed on a black background. Each of the diagrams features a light bulb, with the first light bulb located on the left side of the image, the second light bulb in the middle, and the third light bulb on the right side.
In addition to the light bulbs, each of the diagrams also includes a number of arrows. The arrows are scattered throughout the diagrams, with some arrows pointing towards the light bulbs and others pointing away from them. The arrows are positioned at various angles and heights, adding visual interest and complexity to the diagrams.

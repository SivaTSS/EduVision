The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, focusing on the mantle and the core. The mantle is divided into two sections: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle extends from the Earth's surface to a depth of approximately 2,900 kilometers, while the lower mantle extends from 2,900 kilometers to 5,100 kilometers below the Earth's surface.
The Earth's core is further divided into the outer core and the inner core. The outer core extends from the Earth's surface to a depth of approximately 5,100 kilometers, while the inner core extends from 5,100 kilometers to 12,200 kilometers below the Earth's surface.
In addition to the cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, the image also shows the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core. This movement creates electric currents, which in turn generate a magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field helps to protect the planet from the

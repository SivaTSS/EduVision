In the image, there is a diagram showing the process of photosynthesis in a plant. The main components of the process include sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, and chlorophyll. The sunlight provides energy to the plant, and the carbon dioxide and water are used to create glucose through the process of photosynthesis. The glucose is then used by the plant as a source of energy. The chlorophyll, which is the green pigment found in plant cells, plays a crucial role in the process by absorbing sunlight and converting it into energy for the plant.

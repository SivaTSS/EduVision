The image depicts a circular flowchart that illustrates the process of sedimentation and the formation of sedimentary rocks. The flowchart is divided into several sections, each representing a different stage in the process.
In the center of the flowchart, there is a large circle that represents the formation of sedimentary rocks. Surrounding this central circle are several smaller circles, each representing a different stage in the sedimentation process.
The flowchart begins with the formation of sedimentary rocks, followed by the transportation of these rocks by water, wind, or ice. Next, the rocks are deposited in various environments, such as oceans, lakes, or rivers. Finally, the sedimentary rocks are subjected to various processes, such as compaction, cementation, and diagenesis, which result in the formation of different types of sedimentary rocks, such as sandstones, shales, and limestones.
Overall, the flowchart provides a comprehensive overview of the process of sedimentation and the formation of sedimentary rocks.

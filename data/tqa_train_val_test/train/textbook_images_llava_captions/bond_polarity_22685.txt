In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation. The first diagram shows the oxidation of carbon monoxide, while the second one shows the oxidation of carbon dioxide.
In the first diagram, the process starts with the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule, which reacts with oxygen (O2) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). In the second diagram, the process starts with the carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule, which reacts with oxygen (O2) to form carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O).
In both diagrams, the oxygen molecule (O2) is present on the right side of the reactions, indicating that it is the oxidizing agent in these reactions. The carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) molecules are present on the left side of the reactions, indicating that they are the reactants in these reactions. The water (H2O)

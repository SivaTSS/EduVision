In the image, there is a green circle that represents the energy levels and electrons of an atom. The circle is divided into three sections, each representing a different energy level. The first energy level is at the top of the circle, the second energy level is in the middle, and the third energy level is at the bottom of the circle.
Inside the circle, there are several labels that indicate the number of electrons in each energy level. For example, the first energy level has 2 electrons, the second energy level has 8 electrons, and the third energy level has 18 electrons.
Additionally, there is a label in the middle of the circle that indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom. The number of protons in the first energy level is 2, the number of protons in the second energy level is 8, and the number of protons in the third energy level is 18.
Overall, the image provides a clear representation of the energy levels and electrons of an atom, as well as the number of protons in the nucleus.

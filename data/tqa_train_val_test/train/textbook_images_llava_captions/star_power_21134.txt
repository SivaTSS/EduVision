The image depicts a detailed illustration of the sun's interior, showcasing various elements and processes that occur within it. The sun is divided into different sections, such as the core, radiative zone, convective zone, and the photosphere.
In the core, the temperature is extremely high, reaching up to 15 million degrees Celsius. The radiative zone has a temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius, while the convective zone has a temperature of around 5,000 degrees Celsius. The photosphere, which is the visible part of the sun, has a temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius.
The illustration also highlights the various processes that occur within the sun, such as nuclear reactions, convective motions, and magnetic field loops. These processes contribute to the sun's energy production and overall functioning.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive understanding of the sun's internal structure and the processes that take place within it.

In the image, there is a black and white diagram depicting the process of exothermic reaction. The diagram consists of three main components: reactants, energy released, and products. The reactants are shown on the left side of the diagram, while the energy released is located in the middle. The products are shown on the right side of the diagram.
The energy released in the exothermic reaction is depicted as an arrow pointing upwards, signifying the release of energy during the reaction. The products of the exothermic reaction are also shown as an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the final outcome of the reaction.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the exothermic reaction process, including the reactants, energy released, and products involved in the reaction.

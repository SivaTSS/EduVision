In the image, there is a diagram depicting the movement of waves in the ocean. The diagram is divided into four sections, each representing a different aspect of the wave's movement. The first section is labeled "Movement of Water Molecules," which shows the movement of water molecules in the ocean. The second section is labeled "Wave Height," which displays the height of the wave. The third section is labeled "Wave Length," which shows the length of the wave. Finally, the fourth section is labeled "Wave Crest," which illustrates the crest of the wave. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the various factors that contribute to the formation and movement of waves in the ocean.

The image depicts a water cycle that starts with the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. This condensed water is then transported from plants through the process of transpiration. The water is then collected in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. From there, it evaporates back into the atmosphere, completing the water cycle.
In the image, there is a mountain with a cloud above it, representing the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. A tree is also visible in the scene, symbolizing the transpiration process by which plants release water vapor into the air.

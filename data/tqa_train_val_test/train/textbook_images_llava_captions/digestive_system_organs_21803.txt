In the image, there are three diagrams showing the progression of a cell dividing into two cells. The diagrams are labeled with numbers one, two, and three. The first diagram shows a single cell, while the second and third diagrams depict the cell dividing into two separate cells.
In each of the three diagrams, there is an arrow pointing towards the center of the cell, indicating the process of cell division. Additionally, there are small black dots scattered throughout the diagrams, possibly representing the cell's structure or components.

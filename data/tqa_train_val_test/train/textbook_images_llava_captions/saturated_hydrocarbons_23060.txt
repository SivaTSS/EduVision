The image shows the chemical structure of an ethane molecule. Ethane is a colorless, odorless gas that is commonly used as a fuel source. The molecule is composed of four carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms. The carbon atoms are arranged in a tetrahedral shape, and the hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms to form the ethane molecule.
In the image, the carbon atoms are represented by black circles, while the hydrogen atoms are represented by white circles. The four carbon atoms are arranged in a square shape, with each carbon atom connected to two other carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom. The six hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms, with one hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.
Overall, the image provides a clear representation of the ethane molecule and its chemical structure.

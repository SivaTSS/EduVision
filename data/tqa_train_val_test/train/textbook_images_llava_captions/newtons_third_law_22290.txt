In the image, there are two trucks, one red and the other white. The red truck is traveling at a speed of 100 km/h, while the white truck is traveling at a speed of 200 km/h. The red truck has a brake light on, indicating that it is slowing down. The white truck, on the other hand, has its brake light off, suggesting that it is not slowing down.
There is also a car in the image, which is traveling at a speed of 300 km/h. The car is positioned between the two trucks, with the red truck on the left and the white truck on the right. The car's speed is significantly higher than both trucks, making it the fastest vehicle in the scene.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the Earth's surface. One of the diagrams is a plan view of the Earth's surface, while the other is a cross-sectional view of the Earth's surface.
The plan view shows the Earth's surface as a flat, two-dimensional surface. The cross-sectional view, on the other hand, provides a three-dimensional perspective of the Earth's surface, showing the layers beneath the surface.
In the cross-sectional view, the Earth's layers include the crust, mantle, and core. The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, while the mantle is the layer beneath the crust. The core is the innermost layer of the Earth, and it is divided into the outer core and the inner core. The outer core is a liquid layer, while the inner core is a solid, metallic layer.
Overall, the two diagrams provide a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's surface and its internal structure.

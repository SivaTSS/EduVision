In the image, there is an illustration of a pulmonary gas exchange process. The illustration shows the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the bloodstream. The lungs are depicted as the source of oxygen, while the bloodstream is shown as the destination for the oxygen. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is transported from the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled.
The illustration consists of two main arrows, one pointing from the lungs to the bloodstream and the other pointing from the bloodstream to the lungs. These arrows represent the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide during the pulmonary gas exchange process.

In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and the concentration of phosphorus (PH) in ocean water. The graph shows that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing over the years, while the concentration of PH in the ocean water has been decreasing. The graph also shows that the concentration of PH in the ocean water is significantly lower than the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

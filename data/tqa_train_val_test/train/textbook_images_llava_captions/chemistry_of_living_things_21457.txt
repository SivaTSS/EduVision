In the image, there is a red and white molecular model of a water molecule. The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is located at the center of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms are positioned on either side of the oxygen atom. The red part of the molecule represents the oxygen atom, while the white part represents the hydrogen atoms. This molecular model provides a visual representation of the structure and composition of a water molecule.

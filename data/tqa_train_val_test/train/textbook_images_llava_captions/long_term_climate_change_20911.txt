This is a graph showing the levels of atmospheric CO2 and the glacial cycles over a period of 650,000 years. The graph is divided into several sections, each representing a different time period. The vertical axis shows the levels of atmospheric CO2, while the horizontal axis represents the time period in years.
The graph shows that the levels of atmospheric CO2 have been steadily increasing over the past 650,000 years, with a noticeable spike in the last 200 years. The glacial cycles, on the other hand, show a pattern of alternating cold and warm periods, with the most recent period being the current interglacial period.
The graph is labeled with various names and numbers, indicating the different time periods and levels of atmospheric CO2. Overall, the graph provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between atmospheric CO2 levels and the glacial cycles over the past 650,000 years.

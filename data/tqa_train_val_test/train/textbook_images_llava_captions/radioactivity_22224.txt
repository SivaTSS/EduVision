This is a periodic table of elements. It shows the atomic number, symbol, and name of each element. The table is divided into two sections, one for metals and the other for non-metals. The metals are on the left side of the table, while the non-metals are on the right side. The elements are arranged in order of their atomic number, with the lightest elements at the top and the heaviest elements at the bottom. Each element has a unique symbol, such as H for hydrogen, He for helium, and U for uranium. The table also includes the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons for each element, as well as information about the element's physical and chemical properties, such as its melting and boiling points, and its reactivity with other elements.

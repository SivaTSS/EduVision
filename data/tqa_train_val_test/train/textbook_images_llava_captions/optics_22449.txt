In the image, there is a visual representation of a convex mirror. The mirror is described as a "convex mirror," and it appears to be a three-dimensional representation of a mirror. The mirror is placed in the center of the image, surrounded by several arrows pointing in different directions. These arrows are likely used to illustrate the mirror's curvature and how it reflects light differently compared to a flat mirror. The visual representation provides a clear understanding of the mirror's structure and how it functions in capturing and reflecting light.

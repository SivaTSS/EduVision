In the image, there is a representation of the solar system on a white background. The main focus of the image is the Earth, which is located in the center of the solar system. The Earth is surrounded by several other celestial bodies, including the moon, which is positioned to the left of the Earth.
In addition to the Earth and the moon, there are three other planets visible in the image. One planet is located to the right of the Earth, while the other two planets are positioned on the left side of the solar system.
There are also two orbits visible in the image. One orbit is located above the Earth, while the other orbit is positioned below the Earth. These orbits likely represent the paths taken by the celestial bodies as they move around the solar system.

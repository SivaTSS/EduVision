In the image, there is a frozen waterway surrounded by snow-covered ground. The waterway appears to be a drainage ditch, and it is filled with snow and ice. There are several icicles hanging from the sides of the ditch, adding to the wintry atmosphere.
In addition to the frozen waterway, there are a few potted plants scattered throughout the scene, adding a touch of greenery to the otherwise snow-covered landscape. The combination of the frozen waterway, the icicles, and the potted plants creates a picturesque winter scene.

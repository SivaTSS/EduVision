In the image, there is a rocky cliff with a mix of red, yellow, and brown colors. The cliff is adorned with a variety of plants, including bushes, grass, and a tree. The plants are scattered throughout the scene, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The combination of the rocky cliff and the lush vegetation creates a striking contrast between the natural and man-made elements in the image.

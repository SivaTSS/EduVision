In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the carbon cycle. The cycle starts with the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The CO2 is absorbed by plants and algae through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. Animals, such as cows, then consume the plants and algae, releasing the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere through their digestive processes. The cycle continues as the carbon dioxide is absorbed by the plants and algae once again, completing the carbon cycle.
In the image, there is a house, a cow, and a potted plant. The house represents the burning of fossil fuels, the cow represents the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants, and the potted plant represents the absorption of carbon dioxide by algae.

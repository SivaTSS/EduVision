In the image, there are two pictures side by side. The left picture shows a pile of black rocks, while the right picture displays a bowl filled with white powder. The white powder appears to be sugar, as it is commonly used for sweetening food and beverages. The contrast between the black rocks and the white powder creates an interesting visual effect, highlighting the differences between these two objects.

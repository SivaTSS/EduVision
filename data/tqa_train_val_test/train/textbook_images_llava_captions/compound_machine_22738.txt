In the image, there is a wine bottle with a cork in it. The cork is held in place by a corkscrew. The corkscrew is made up of several parts, including a handle, a spiral, and a screw. The handle is located at the top of the corkscrew, while the spiral is situated in the middle, and the screw is located at the bottom. The corkscrew is used to remove the cork from the wine bottle, making it easier to pour the wine.

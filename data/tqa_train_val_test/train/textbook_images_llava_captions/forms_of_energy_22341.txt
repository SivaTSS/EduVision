In the image, there is a close-up of a can of Energizer lithium batteries next to a lightning bolt. The lightning bolt takes up a significant portion of the image, stretching from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The can of Energizer lithium batteries is positioned towards the right side of the image.
Below the lightning bolt and the Energizer lithium batteries, there is a caption that reads, "Average lightning bolt has about 500,000 joules of electrical energy!"

In the image, there are two side-by-side images of the Earth. The first image is a close-up of the Arctic region, while the second image is a close-up of the Antarctic region. Both images show the thickness of the sea ice in the respective regions.
In the Arctic region, the thickness of the sea ice ranges from 1 to 10 years, with an average of 5 years. In the Antarctic region, the thickness of the sea ice ranges from 10 to 100 years, with an average of 50 years. These images provide a clear visual representation of the differences in sea ice thickness between the Arctic and Antarctic regions.

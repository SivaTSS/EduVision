In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the different types of waves in the ocean. There are three main types of waves: breaking waves, cresting waves, and steepening waves.
Breaking waves are the most common type of wave, and they occur when a wave approaches the shore. As the wave reaches the shoreline, it begins to break, causing the water to become choppy and turbulent.
Cresting waves, on the other hand, are the highest part of the wave, and they occur when a wave reaches its peak. The crest of the wave is the point at which the wave's energy is at its highest.
Steepening waves, as the name suggests, occur when a wave becomes steeper as it approaches the shore. This type of wave is less common than breaking and cresting waves.
The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the different types of waves in the ocean, highlighting their unique characteristics and behaviors.

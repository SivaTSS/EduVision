In the image, there is a close-up view of the human eye, focusing on the retina and the optic nerve. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye, and the optic nerve is the nerve that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.
There are several labels on the image, including "retina," "optic nerve," and "iris." The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light entering the eye, and it is located in the center of the image. The optic nerve can be seen extending from the center of the retina towards the top of the image, while the retina occupies a large portion of the lower half of the image.

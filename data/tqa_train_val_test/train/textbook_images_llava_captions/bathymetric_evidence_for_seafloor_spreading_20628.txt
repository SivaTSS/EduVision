In the image, there is a diagram depicting the continental shelf and the continental rise. The continental shelf is a gently sloping area of the ocean floor that extends from the coastline to the edge of the continental shelf. The continental rise, on the other hand, is a steeply sloping area of the ocean floor that extends from the edge of the continental shelf to the depths of the ocean.
In the diagram, the continental shelf is labeled as "continental shelf," and the continental rise is labeled as "continental rise." The continental shelf and the continental rise meet at the edge of the continental shelf, where the continental shelf transitions into the steeply sloping area of the continental rise.

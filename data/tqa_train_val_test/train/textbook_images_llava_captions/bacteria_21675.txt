In the image, there is a flowchart that illustrates the process of applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria. The flowchart consists of three main steps: after selection, final population, and resistance level.
The first step, "after selection," shows the process of selecting the bacteria that will be treated with antibiotics. The second step, "final population," represents the goal of reducing the bacteria population to a manageable level. The third and final step, "resistance level," illustrates the possibility of the bacteria developing resistance to the antibiotics over time.
The flowchart is composed of red and yellow dots, with the red dots representing the bacteria and the yellow dots representing the antibiotics. The dots are arranged in a way that demonstrates the progression of the antibiotic application process.

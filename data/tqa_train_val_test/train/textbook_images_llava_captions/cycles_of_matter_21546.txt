The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process that involves the movement of water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. The diagram illustrates the various stages of the water cycle, including:
1. Condensation: Water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets, forming clouds.
2. Evaporation: Water droplets in the clouds evaporate, returning water vapor to the atmosphere.
3. Precipitation: Water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses, forming rain or snow.
4. Surface runoff: Rain or melting snow flows over the Earth's surface into rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water.
5. Ground-water recharge: Surface runoff is absorbed into the ground, replenishing ground-water sources.
6. Evapotranspiration: Plants absorb water through their roots and release water vapor through their leaves, contributing to the water cycle.
7. Storage: Water is stored in various reservoirs, such as lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers.

In the image, there is a graph showing the average ozone air quality index (AQI) over a 24-hour period. The AQI is measured on a scale of 0 to 500, with 0 being the best and 500 being the worst. The graph shows that the air quality is generally good, with the AQI staying below 100 for most of the day. However, there are a few instances where the AQI rises above 100, indicating that the air quality is not as good as it could be. Overall, the graph shows that the air quality in the area is generally good, but there are some periods where it could be improved.

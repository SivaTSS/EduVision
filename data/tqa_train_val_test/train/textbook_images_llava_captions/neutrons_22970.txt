In the image, there are three diagrams illustrating the nucleus of a carbon isotope. The diagrams show the number of protons and neutrons in each isotope. The first isotope has 6 protons and 7 neutrons, the second isotope has 7 protons and 8 neutrons, and the third isotope has 8 protons and 9 neutrons. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure and composition of the carbon isotopes.

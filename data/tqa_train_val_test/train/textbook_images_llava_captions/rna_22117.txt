This is a diagram showing the structure of a DNA molecule. The DNA molecule is composed of four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These nucleotides are arranged in a specific sequence to form the DNA double helix. The double helix is made up of two complementary strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds.
In the diagram, the four nucleotides are represented by different colors, with A being blue, C being green, G being red, and T being yellow. The double helix is depicted as a spiral staircase, with each step representing one of the four nucleotides. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the structure of a DNA molecule, which is essential for understanding genetics and the functioning of living organisms.

In the image, a woman is playing volleyball on a court. She is wearing a white shirt and red shorts, and she is in the process of hitting a volleyball with her hand. The volleyball is in mid-air, close to the woman's hand, as she prepares to make contact with it.
There are two other people in the scene, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the court. A sports ball, likely a volleyball, can be seen on the right side of the court as well.

The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is a continuous process that involves the movement of water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. The diagram illustrates the various stages of the water cycle, including precipitation, surface runoff, ground-water storage, evapotranspiration, and condensation.
1. Precipitation: Rain or snow falls from the atmosphere onto the Earth's surface.
2. Surface Runoff: The excess water from precipitation flows over the land's surface into rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water.
3. Ground-Water Storage: The water from surface runoff is absorbed by the ground and stored in underground aquifers or reservoirs.
4. Evapotranspiration: The stored water is released back into the atmosphere through the process of evapotranspiration, which involves the evaporation of water from the ground and the transpiration of water from plants.
5. Condensation: The water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and forms clouds or dew, which eventually precipitates back onto the Earth's surface.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The diagrams depict the concept of force, specifically focusing on force A. The diagrams show the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.
In one of the diagrams, there is a red arrow pointing upwards, indicating an upward force. In the other diagram, there is a red arrow pointing downwards, representing a downward force. These diagrams help illustrate the concept of force and its impact on an object's motion.

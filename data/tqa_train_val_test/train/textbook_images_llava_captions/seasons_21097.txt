In the image, there is a diagram showing the high density of incidental rays in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter season. The diagram is divided into two main sections, with one section showing the high density of incidental rays, and the other section showing the low density of incidental rays in the Southern Hemisphere during the summer season.
The high density of incidental rays in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter season is represented by a large number of arrows pointing in the same direction. On the other hand, the low density of incidental rays in the Southern Hemisphere during the summer season is represented by a smaller number of arrows pointing in the opposite direction.
Overall, the image effectively illustrates the difference in incidental ray density between the two hemispheres, with the Northern Hemisphere experiencing a higher density of incidental rays during the winter season, and the Southern Hemisphere experiencing a lower density of incidental rays during the summer season.

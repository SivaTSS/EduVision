The image depicts a bar graph showing the distribution of water on Earth. The x-axis represents the different types of water, while the y-axis shows the percentage of each type. The bar graph is divided into three sections, each representing a different type of water.
The first section, on the left side of the graph, shows the distribution of ground water. The second section, in the middle of the graph, shows the distribution of lakes. The third section, on the right side of the graph, shows the distribution of ice caps, glaciers, and atmospheric moisture.
Overall, the bar graph provides a clear visual representation of the distribution of water on Earth, highlighting the different types and their respective percentages.

In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
The first diagram focuses on the process of photosynthesis, which involves the conversion of sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The process starts with the absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll, followed by the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through a series of chemical reactions.
In the second diagram, the process of cellular respiration is depicted. This process involves the breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The process starts with glycolysis, followed by the citric acid cycle, and finally ending with oxidative phosphorylation.
Both diagrams show the interconnectedness and interdependence of these processes, highlighting the importance of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in the functioning of living organisms.

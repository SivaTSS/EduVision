The image depicts a visual representation of the solar system, focusing on the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. The corona is the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, while the chromosphere is the layer just below the corona.
In the image, there are three main regions: the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona. The chromosphere has a temperature of around 4,000 degrees Celsius, while the transition region has a temperature of around 10,000 degrees Celsius. The corona, on the other hand, has a temperature of around 10 million degrees Celsius.
Additionally, there are two smaller regions in the image: the photosphere and the prominence. The photosphere is the innermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, and it has a temperature of around 5,500 degrees Celsius. The prominence is a plasma cloud that forms above the sun's surface, and it has a temperature of around 8,000 degrees Celsius.
Overall, the image provides a detailed

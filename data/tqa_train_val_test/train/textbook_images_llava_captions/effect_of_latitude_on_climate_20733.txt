In the image, there is a globe of the Earth with a red line passing through the center of the globe. This line represents the Antarctic Circle, which is an imaginary line on the Earth's surface at a latitude of 66.5 degrees south. The Antarctic Circle divides the Earth into two equal halves, with one half being south of the line and the other half being north of the line. This line is significant as it marks the boundary between the Southern Hemisphere and the Antarctic region.

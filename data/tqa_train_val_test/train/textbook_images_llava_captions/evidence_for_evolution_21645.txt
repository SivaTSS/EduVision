The image depicts a geological cross-section of a mountain, showcasing various layers of rock and sediment. There are six distinct layers visible in the cross-section, each representing a different stage of the mountain's formation.
In addition to the layers, there are six small circles scattered throughout the cross-section. These circles likely represent different types of rocks or minerals found within the layers. The combination of the layers and the circles provides a comprehensive view of the mountain's geological structure.

In the image, there is a beaker filled with water, and a tube is connected to the beaker. The tube is connected to a battery, and the water in the beaker is being used as a conductor for the electrical current. The electrical current is flowing through the tube and into the beaker, causing the water to rise. This demonstrates the concept of electrolysis, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen gases when an electrical current is passed through it.

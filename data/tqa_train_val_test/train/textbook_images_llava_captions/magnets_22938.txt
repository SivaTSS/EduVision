In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the concept of lines of force. The first diagram shows the lines of force for a north pole and a south pole, while the second diagram shows the lines of force for a north pole and a south pole that are two north poles apart.
In both diagrams, the lines of force are represented by blue and red colors, with the blue lines representing the south pole and the red lines representing the north pole. The diagrams help to visualize and understand the concept of electromagnetic forces and how they interact with each other.

In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between time and acceleration. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents acceleration in meters per second squared (m/s^2).
There are several labels on the graph, including "Positive," "Negative," "Acceleration," "Zero," and "B Acceleration." The "Positive" and "Negative" labels indicate the direction of acceleration, while the "Acceleration" label refers to the actual acceleration value. The "Zero" and "B Acceleration" labels likely represent the starting and ending points of the acceleration curve, respectively.
The graph itself has a triangular shape, with the "Positive" and "Negative" labels positioned at the top and bottom of the triangle, respectively. The "Zero" and "B Acceleration" labels are located at the left and right sides of the triangle, respectively.

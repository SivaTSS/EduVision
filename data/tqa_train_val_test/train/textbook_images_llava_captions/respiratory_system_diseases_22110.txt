In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of an asthma attack. The first diagram shows the progression of an asthma attack, starting with the contraction of the airways, followed by the accumulation of mucus in the airways, and finally, the narrowing of the airways due to inflammation.
In the second diagram, the airways are shown to be filled with mucus during an asthma attack. The mucus accumulates in the airways, making it difficult for the person to breathe.
Both diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the various stages of an asthma attack, highlighting the importance of proper treatment and management of the condition.

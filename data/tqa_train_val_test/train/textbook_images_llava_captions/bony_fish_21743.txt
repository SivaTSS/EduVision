In the image, there are two pictures of a fish. The first picture shows the fish in its natural habitat, swimming in a body of water. The second picture displays the fish in an aquarium, surrounded by water. The fish in the aquarium appears to be dead, while the fish in the natural habitat is alive and swimming. The two pictures are placed side by side, showcasing the difference between the fish in its natural environment and the fish in captivity.

In the image, the solar system is depicted with the sun at the center, surrounded by the nine planets. The planets are arranged in the order they orbit the sun, starting with Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Each planet is represented by a circle, with the size of the circle corresponding to the size of the planet relative to the sun. The sun is depicted as a large yellow circle in the center of the image, with the planets surrounding it. The arrangement of the planets and the sun creates a visually appealing representation of our solar system.

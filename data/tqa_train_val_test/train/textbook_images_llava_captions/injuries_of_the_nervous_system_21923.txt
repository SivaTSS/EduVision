In the image, there is a man sitting in a wheelchair in front of a chalkboard. The man is wearing a black shirt and has a tube coming out of his mouth. He appears to be in a classroom or a similar setting.
The chalkboard is located on the left side of the man, and there is a cup placed on the right side of the chalkboard. The man's wheelchair takes up a significant portion of the scene, extending from the left to the right side of the image.

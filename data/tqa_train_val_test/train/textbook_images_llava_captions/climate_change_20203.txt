The image depicts a global climate model of the Earth's surface air temperature change from 1979 to 2020. The model is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GFDL CM2.1 climate model.
The map is divided into several regions, including North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Each region displays the change in surface air temperature over the years. The temperature changes are represented by a color gradient, with warmer colors indicating higher temperatures and cooler colors indicating lower temperatures.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the Earth's surface air temperature change from 1979 to 2020 based on the NOAA GFDL CM2.1 climate model.

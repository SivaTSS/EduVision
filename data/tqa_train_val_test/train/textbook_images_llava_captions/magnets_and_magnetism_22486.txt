In the image, there is a close-up view of a compass on a piece of paper. The compass consists of a needle and a dial. The needle is located in the center of the compass, while the dial is positioned to the left of the needle.
In addition to the compass, there are three coins placed around it. One coin is located to the left of the compass, while the other two coins are positioned to the right of the compass. The arrangement of the coins and the compass creates a visually interesting scene.

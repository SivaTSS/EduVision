In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the human body's respiratory system. The diagrams show the difference between inhalation and exhalation. In the first diagram, the inhalation process is depicted, with air flowing into the lungs. In the second diagram, the exhalation process is shown, with air flowing out of the lungs.
In both diagrams, the lungs are clearly visible, along with the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The diagrams also show the diaphragm, which plays a crucial role in both inhalation and exhalation. The diaphragm contracts during inhalation and relaxes during exhalation, allowing air to flow in and out of the lungs.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the human body's respiratory system and the processes involved in inhalation and exhalation.

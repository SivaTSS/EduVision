In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating different types of waves. The first diagram depicts a transverse wave, which is a type of wave that travels perpendicular to the direction of the wave. The second diagram shows a longitudinal wave, which is a type of wave that travels parallel to the direction of the wave.
In the transverse wave diagram, there are two arrows pointing in opposite directions. The first arrow represents the direction of the wave, while the second arrow represents the direction of the wave's movement. The second arrow is positioned at a 90-degree angle to the first arrow.
In the longitudinal wave diagram, there are two arrows pointing in the same direction. The first arrow represents the direction of the wave, while the second arrow represents the direction of the wave's movement. The second arrow is positioned at a 0-degree angle to the first arrow.

The image features a carbon monoxide alarm, which is designed to detect the presence of carbon monoxide gas in the air. The alarm is white in color and has a sticker on the back that reads "Do Not Paint." The sticker serves as a reminder not to paint the alarm, as the paint may interfere with the alarm's ability to detect carbon monoxide. The alarm is placed on a white surface, making it stand out and be easily noticeable.

This is a periodic table of the elements. The table is divided into two sections, one for metals and the other for non-metals. The metals section is on the left side of the table, while the non-metals section is on the right side.
In the metals section, the elements are arranged from left to right, starting with hydrogen (H) at the top left corner and ending with plutonium (Pu) at the bottom right corner. The elements in the non-metals section are arranged similarly, starting with hydrogen (H) at the top left corner and ending with uranium (U) at the bottom right corner.
Each element is labeled with its atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The elements are also labeled with their symbol, which is a one- or two-letter abbreviation representing the element's name.

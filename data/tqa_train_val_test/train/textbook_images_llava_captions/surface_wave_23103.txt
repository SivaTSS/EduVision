In the image, there is a visual representation of the movement of waves in a surface wave. The wave is depicted as a red circle, and the energy of the wave is shown as a blue circle. The energy of the wave passes through the surface of the water, creating a ripple effect.
There is also a description of the wave's movement in the form of text. The text explains that the wave moves in a circular motion, with the energy of the wave passing through the surface of the water, creating a ripple effect. The image provides a clear visual representation of the wave's movement in a surface wave, making it easier to understand the concept.

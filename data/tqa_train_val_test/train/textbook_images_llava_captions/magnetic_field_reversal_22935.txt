The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, focusing on the mantle and the core. The mantle is divided into two sections: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle extends from the Earth's surface to a depth of approximately 2,900 kilometers, while the lower mantle extends from 2,900 to 5,100 kilometers below the surface.
The Earth's core is further divided into the outer core and the inner core. The outer core extends from the Earth's surface to a depth of approximately 5,100 kilometers, while the inner core extends from 5,100 to 12,200 kilometers below the surface. The outer core is primarily composed of liquid iron, while the inner core is primarily composed of solid iron.
The image also shows the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core. The Earth's magnetic field helps to protect the planet from the harmful effects of solar radiation.

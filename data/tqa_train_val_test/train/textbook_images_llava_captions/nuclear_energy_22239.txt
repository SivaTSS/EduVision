In the image, there is a diagram showing the process of fusion reactions. The main components of the diagram include a reactor, a helium bled pipe, and a neutron source. The reactor is located at the top left corner of the image, while the helium bled pipe is situated in the middle of the image. The neutron source can be found at the bottom right corner of the image.
The diagram also features several arrows pointing in different directions, likely indicating the flow of energy or the movement of particles during the fusion reactions. Additionally, there are two oranges in the image, one located at the top right corner and the other at the bottom right corner. These oranges might be used as a visual aid to help explain the concept of fusion reactions.

In the image, there is a detailed diagram of a heating and cooling system. The main components of the system include a furnace, a warm air register, and a cold air return duct. The furnace is responsible for heating the air, while the warm air register distributes the heated air throughout the house. The cold air return duct, on the other hand, collects the cold air from the house and returns it to the furnace to be heated again. This system helps maintain a comfortable temperature in the house by circulating warm and cold air efficiently.

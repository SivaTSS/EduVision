In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the chemical structures of two different substances. The first substance is labeled as "butane," and the second substance is labeled as "but-1-ene." The diagrams show the molecular structure of each substance, including the arrangement of atoms and the bonds between them.
The first substance, butane, is a colorless gas that is commonly used as a propellant in aerosol cans. The second substance, but-1-ene, is a colorless gas that is commonly used as a propellant in aerosol cans as well. Both substances have a similar chemical structure, with the main difference being the presence of a double bond in but-1-ene.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the molecular structures of these two substances, highlighting their similarities and differences.

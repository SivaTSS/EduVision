In the image, there is an illustration of a molecule called Nucleotide. The Nucleotide molecule is composed of three main parts: a nitrogen base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. The nitrogen base can be either adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine. The sugar molecule can be either ribose or deoxyribose, and the phosphate group is composed of a phosphorus atom and four oxygen atoms.
The illustration also shows the chemical structure of the Nucleotide molecule, with the nitrogen base, sugar molecule, and phosphate group represented by different shapes and colors. The nitrogen base is shown in blue, the sugar molecule is shown in orange, and the phosphate group is shown in green.
In addition to the Nucleotide molecule, there is also an illustration of a sugar molecule and a phosphate group. The sugar molecule is shown in orange, and the phosphate group is shown in green.

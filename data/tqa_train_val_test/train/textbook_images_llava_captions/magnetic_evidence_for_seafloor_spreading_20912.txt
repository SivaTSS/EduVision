The image depicts a cross-section of a mid-ocean ridge, showcasing the geological processes occurring beneath the ocean's surface. The mid-ocean ridge is characterized by magma rising from the depths of the Earth's mantle, creating new oceanic crust as it cools and solidifies.
In the image, there is a clear distinction between the magma and the surrounding oceanic crust. The magma is represented by a red line, while the oceanic crust is shown as a lighter-colored area. The mid-ocean ridge stretches across the entire width of the image, illustrating the vast scale of this geological phenomenon.

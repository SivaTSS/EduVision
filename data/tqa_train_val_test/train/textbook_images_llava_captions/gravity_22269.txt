In the image, a person's hand is holding a hand-held scale, which is measuring the weight of a stack of money. The person's hand can be seen on the left side of the scale, while the stack of money is on the right side. The stack of money consists of several bills, including a $100 bill, a $50 bill, a $20 bill, and a $10 bill. These bills are piled on top of each other, with the $100 bill at the bottom, followed by the $50 bill, the $20 bill, and finally, the $10 bill on top. The hand-held scale provides an accurate measurement of the total weight of the stack of money.

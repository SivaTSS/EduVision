The Plum Pudding Model of an Atom is a visual representation of the structure of an atom. In this model, the protons and neutrons are depicted as raisins, while the electrons are represented by plums. The raisins and plums are arranged in a spherical shape, with the raisins forming the core and the plums surrounding it. The electrons are distributed throughout the spherical structure, with some closer to the raisins and others further away. This model provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the composition and structure of an atom.

In the image, there is a graph showing the temperature of the air at different altitudes. The graph shows that the temperature decreases as the altitude increases, with the lowest temperatures occurring at the highest altitudes. The graph is labeled with the term "thermocline," which refers to the boundary between the warmer air near the surface and the colder air at higher altitudes.
In addition to the main graph, there are several arrows pointing to different parts of the graph. These arrows likely indicate specific points of interest, such as the temperature at a particular altitude or the direction in which the temperature is decreasing. Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the thermocline and its relationship to temperature and altitude.

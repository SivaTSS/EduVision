The image is a black and white drawing of a man wearing a wig and a robe. The man is sitting at a table with a book in front of him. He is holding a pipe in his hand and appears to be smoking it. The man's attire and the presence of the book suggest that he might be a scholar or an intellectual. The drawing captures a moment of leisure or contemplation for the man as he enjoys his pipe and the company of his book.

In the image, there is a line graph showing trends in global average absolute sea level from 1870 to 2008. The graph is divided into three sections, with each section representing a different time period. The first section is from 1870 to 1950, the second section is from 1950 to 2000, and the third section is from 2000 to 2008.
The graph shows a steady increase in the global average absolute sea level over the years, indicating a rise in sea levels due to various factors such as climate change, melting glaciers, and thermal expansion of seawater.

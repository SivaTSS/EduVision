In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. One of the diagrams is a three-dimensional representation of a graphite crystal, while the other is a two-dimensional representation of the same graphite crystal.
The three-dimensional graphite crystal is depicted as a honeycomb-like structure with hexagonal cells. The two-dimensional graphite crystal is shown as a square grid with hexagonal cells.
In addition to the diagrams, there is a can of spray paint on the right side of the image.

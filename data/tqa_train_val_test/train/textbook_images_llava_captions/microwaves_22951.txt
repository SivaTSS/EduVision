In the image, there are two cars, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. The car on the left side is a police car, while the car on the right side is a regular car. The police car has a radar gun attached to it, which is used to detect the speed of other vehicles. The radar gun emits a beam of electromagnetic waves that bounce off the vehicle and return to the radar gun, allowing the police officer to determine the vehicle's speed.

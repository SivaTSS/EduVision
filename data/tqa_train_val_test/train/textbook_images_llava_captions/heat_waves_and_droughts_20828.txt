In the image, there is a map of the United States that has been altered to show the amount of emitted heat radiation in watts per square meter (W/m^2) across the country. The colors on the map represent different levels of emitted heat radiation, with darker shades indicating higher levels and lighter shades indicating lower levels.
The map is divided into various regions, such as the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West Coast. Each region has a distinct color scheme, allowing for easy identification of the areas with the highest and lowest levels of emitted heat radiation.
Overall, the image provides a visual representation of the country's emitted heat radiation distribution, which can be useful for understanding climate patterns and energy consumption in different regions.

The image displays a molecular model of a water molecule. The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms are positioned at the top and bottom of the molecule, while the oxygen atom is located in the middle. The molecule is depicted as a three-dimensional structure, with the oxygen atom at the center and the hydrogen atoms surrounding it.

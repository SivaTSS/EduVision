In the image, there are two drawings of the moon, one on the left and one on the right. The drawings show the moon at different stages of its orbit around the Earth.
In the left drawing, the moon is in its first quarter phase, which means it is halfway between the new moon and the full moon. The right drawing shows the moon in its third quarter phase, meaning it is halfway between the full moon and the new moon.
In both drawings, the moon is surrounded by various celestial objects, such as planets, stars, and other moons. These objects are scattered around the moon, adding to the complexity and beauty of the drawings.

In the image, there are two red poles sticking out of the ground in a snow-covered field. The poles have red flags on top of them. The field is surrounded by trees, creating a picturesque winter scene. The two poles are positioned close to each other, with one being closer to the left side of the image and the other being closer to the right side of the image. The red flags on top of the poles stand out against the white snow, adding a touch of color to the otherwise monochromatic landscape.

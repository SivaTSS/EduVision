In the image, there is a diagram showing the different parts of a transverse wave. The wave consists of a crest, a trough, and a cusp. The crest is the highest point of the wave, while the trough is the lowest point. The cusp is the curved part of the wave that connects the crest and the trough. This diagram provides a clear visual representation of the various components that make up a transverse wave.

The image depicts a cross-section of a villus, which is a part of the gastrointestinal tract. The villus is a finger-like protrusion that extends into the lumen of the intestine. The cross-section of the villus is labeled with various nutrients, such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients are absorbed by the villus and transported to the bloodstream.
In the image, there are several tiny blood vessels (capillaries) within the villus. These capillaries facilitate the absorption of nutrients from the lumen of the intestine into the bloodstream. The cross-section of the villus provides a detailed view of the structure and function of this essential part of the gastrointestinal tract.

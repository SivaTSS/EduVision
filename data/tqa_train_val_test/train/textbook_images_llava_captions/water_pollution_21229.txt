In the image, there is a body of water, possibly a river or a lake, with foam and bubbles floating on the surface. The water appears to be murky, and there is a fence near the water's edge.
There are two birds in the scene, one located closer to the left side of the image and the other towards the right side. Both birds seem to be enjoying their time near the water.
Additionally, there are two people in the image. One person can be seen on the left side of the image, while the other person is located on the right side. They might be observing the birds or simply enjoying the view of the water.

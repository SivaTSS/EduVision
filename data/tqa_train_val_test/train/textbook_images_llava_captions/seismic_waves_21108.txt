In the image, there is a diagram showing the focus of a heartquake. The diagram is divided into several sections, including the inner core, outer core, lower mantle, upper mantle, and crust. The inner core is located at the center of the earth and is the hottest part of the planet. The outer core surrounds the inner core and is responsible for the earth's magnetic field. The lower mantle is the layer beneath the outer core, and the upper mantle is the layer above the lower mantle. The crust is the outermost layer of the earth, which includes the continents and oceans.
In addition to these main sections, there are several smaller sections within the diagram, such as the inner core, outer core, lower mantle, upper mantle, and crust. These smaller sections provide more detailed information about the different layers of the earth. Overall, the diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the focus of a heartquake and the various layers that make up our planet.

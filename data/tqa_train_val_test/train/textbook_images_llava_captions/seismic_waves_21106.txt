In the image, there are two diagrams displayed side by side. The diagrams showcase different types of waves, with one focusing on surface waves and the other on subsurface waves.
In the surface wave diagram, there are four different types of waves labeled as A, B, C, and D. Each type of wave has a unique shape and pattern. The subsurface wave diagram, on the other hand, features a single wave labeled as E.
The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the various types of waves and their characteristics, making it easier for viewers to understand and differentiate between them.

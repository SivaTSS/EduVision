The image is a black and white drawing of a fish with a long tail. The fish appears to be swimming in a body of water, possibly the ocean. The tail of the fish is prominently displayed, extending from the back of the fish towards the right side of the image. The fish's body occupies a significant portion of the image, with its head positioned towards the left side. The drawing captures the essence of the fish's anatomy and movement in the water.

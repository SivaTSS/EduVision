The image depicts a circular flowchart that illustrates the process of sedimentation and the formation of sedimentary rocks. In the center of the flowchart, there is a large circle representing the process of sedimentation. The circle is divided into several smaller circles, each representing a different stage in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
The flowchart starts with the formation of igneous rocks, followed by the process of weathering and erosion, which leads to the transportation of sediments by water, wind, or ice. The sediments are then deposited in various environments, such as lakes, oceans, or deserts. Over time, the sediments accumulate and form layers, which eventually become sedimentary rocks.
In addition to the main flowchart, there are several pictures of rocks and other geological features scattered throughout the image, providing a visual representation of the different stages in the formation of sedimentary rocks.

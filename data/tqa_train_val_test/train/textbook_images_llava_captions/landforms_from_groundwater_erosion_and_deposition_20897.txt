In the image, there is a large pothole in the middle of a street. The pothole is filled with dirt, and it appears to be in the process of being repaired. There is a person standing near the pothole, possibly observing the repair work or waiting to cross the street.
In addition to the pothole, there is a fire hydrant located on the right side of the street. The fire hydrant is positioned close to the edge of the street, making it easily accessible in case of emergencies.

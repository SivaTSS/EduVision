The human nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary muscles, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary muscles.
The somatic nervous system is further divided into the motor division, which carries messages from the CNS to the muscles, and the sensory division, which carries messages from the muscles to the CNS. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the parasympathetic division, which prepares the body for rest and relaxation, and the sympathetic division, which prepares the body for action and stress.

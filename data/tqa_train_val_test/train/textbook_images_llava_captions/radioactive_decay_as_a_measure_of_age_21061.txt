In the image, there is a graph showing the decay of a radioactive substance over time. The x-axis represents the age of the samples, while the y-axis shows the amount of radioactive substance remaining. The graph shows that the radioactive substance decreases over time, with the amount gradually decreasing as the age of the samples increases.
There are several points on the graph, each representing a different age of the samples. The first point is on the left side of the graph, while the second point is slightly to the right of the first point. The third point is further to the right, and the fourth point is on the far right side of the graph. These points show the progression of the decay of the radioactive substance over time.

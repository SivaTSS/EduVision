The image depicts a graph showing the relationship between industrial revolution and pre-industrial slow growth. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents the industrial revolution. The graph shows that the industrial revolution began in the 18th century and continued to grow throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The pre-industrial slow growth, on the other hand, began in the 18th century and remained relatively stable until the 19th century, when it began to decline. The decline in pre-industrial slow growth continued until the 20th century, when it became negligible. The graph provides a clear visual representation of the progression of the industrial revolution and the decline of pre-industrial slow growth over time.

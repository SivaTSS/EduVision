In the image, there is a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is composed of various components, including phospholipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. The cell membrane plays a crucial role in regulating the flow of substances in and out of the cell, as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the cell.
The cell membrane is made up of two layers, the inner and outer membranes. The inner membrane, also known as the cytoplasmic membrane, separates the cytoplasm from the rest of the cell. The outer membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, separates the cytoplasm from the extracellular environment.
In addition to these components, the cell membrane also contains various proteins and carbohydrates, which help to regulate the flow of substances in and out of the cell. These proteins and carbohydrates also help to maintain the structural integrity of the cell membrane.
Overall, the cell membrane is a complex structure that plays a vital role in regulating the flow of substances

In the image, there is a close-up view of a human skull, focusing on the frontal lobe of the brain. The skull is separated into different sections, such as the cranium, the frontal lobe, and the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the cerebrum, which is the part of the brain responsible for processing sensory information, motor control, and higher cognitive functions.
In the frontal lobe, there is a green dot, which could be a representation of a neurotransmitter, such as dopamine, serotonin, or norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters play a crucial role in regulating mood, emotions, and cognitive functions.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the human skull and brain, highlighting the intricate structure and function of the cerebral cortex and neurotransmitters in the frontal lobe.

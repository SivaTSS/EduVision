The image depicts a group of wild animals, including two hyenas and a wildebeest, in a grassy field. One of the hyenas is biting the wildebeest, while the other hyena is standing nearby. The wildebeest is lying on the ground, appearing to be the main focus of the hyenas' attention. The scene captures the natural predator-prey relationship between these animals in their natural habitat.

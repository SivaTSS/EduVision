In the image, there is a circular diagram that illustrates the process of air warming, cooling, and rising. The diagram consists of three main sections: air warms, air cools, and air rises.
In the air warms section, the temperature of the air increases as it absorbs heat from its surroundings. In the air cools section, the temperature of the air decreases as it releases heat to its surroundings. Finally, in the air rises section, the warmed or cooled air rises into the atmosphere, contributing to the overall climate and weather patterns.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The diagrams depict the process of a cell dividing into two cells. The first diagram shows a cell dividing into two smaller cells, while the second diagram illustrates a cell dividing into four smaller cells.
In both diagrams, there are arrows pointing to the different stages of the cell division process. The first diagram has three arrows, while the second diagram has four arrows. These arrows indicate the progression of the cell division, from the initial stage to the final stage.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the cell division process.

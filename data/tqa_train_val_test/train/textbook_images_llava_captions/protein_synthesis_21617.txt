In the image, there is a DNA strand that has been transcribed into RNA. The RNA strand is labeled with the word "RNA" on the left side of the image. Alongside the RNA strand, there is an illustration of a double helix structure, which is a common representation of DNA.
In addition to the RNA strand and the double helix structure, there is an illustration of a cell on the right side of the image. The cell is labeled with the word "cell" on the right side of the image. The combination of the RNA strand, the double helix structure, and the cell illustration creates a visual representation of the process of transcribing DNA into RNA.

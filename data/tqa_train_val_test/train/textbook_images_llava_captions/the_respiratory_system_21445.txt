In the image, there is a detailed illustration of the human body, specifically focusing on the respiratory system. The illustration depicts the changes that occur in the lungs and airways during an asthma attack.
There are three different stages of an asthma attack represented in the image. The first stage shows the airways constricting due to inflammation, causing difficulty in breathing. In the second stage, the airways are filled with mucus, making it even more challenging to breathe. Finally, in the third stage, the airways become completely obstructed, resulting in a full-blown asthma attack.
The illustration also shows the process of breathing, with air entering the lungs through the trachea and bronchi, and oxygen being transported to the body's cells. Additionally, the illustration highlights the role of the diaphragm, which plays a crucial part in the process of breathing.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive understanding of the respiratory system and the changes that occur during an asthma attack.

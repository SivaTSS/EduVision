In the image, there is a diagram showing the process of thermal energy radiating through the air from a fire. The diagram consists of three main elements: a sun, a fire, and a hand. The sun is located on the left side of the image, while the fire is situated in the middle. The hand can be seen on the right side of the image, representing the process of thermal energy radiating through the air from the fire.
The sun is the source of the thermal energy, and the fire is the medium through which the energy is radiated. The hand on the right side of the image represents the process of the thermal energy radiating through the air from the fire. This diagram provides a visual representation of the concept of thermal energy radiating through the air from a fire.

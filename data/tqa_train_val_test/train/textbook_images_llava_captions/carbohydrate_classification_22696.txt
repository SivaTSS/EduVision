In the image, there are two diagrams showing the chemical structures of glucose and fructose. The glucose molecule is on the left side of the image, while the fructose molecule is on the right side.
Both molecules are composed of several atoms, including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. The glucose molecule consists of six carbon atoms, while the fructose molecule has five carbon atoms. Both molecules also contain hydrogen and oxygen atoms, with glucose having an additional oxygen atom compared to fructose.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the chemical structures of glucose and fructose, which are essential for understanding their properties and functions in the body.

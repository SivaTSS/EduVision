In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the sources of pollutants in the atmosphere and their effects on the environment. The diagram is divided into three main sections: sources, pollutants in the atmosphere, and effects on the environment.
The sources of pollutants include natural sources, such as volcanoes and wildfires, as well as human-made sources, such as industrial processes, transportation, and waste disposal. The pollutants in the atmosphere include greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as other pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.
The effects of these pollutants on the environment include climate change, acid rain, smog, and respiratory illnesses. The diagram also highlights the importance of receptors in detecting and measuring pollutants in the atmosphere.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the sources of pollutants, their effects on the environment, and the role of receptors in monitoring and mitigating these pollutants.

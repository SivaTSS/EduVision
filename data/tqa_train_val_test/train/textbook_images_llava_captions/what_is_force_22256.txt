In the image, there is a wooden table with a force of 20 newtons pulling it down. The table is positioned at the top of the image, and the force is pulling it towards the bottom of the image. There is also a force of 20 newtons pushing the table upwards, which is located at the bottom of the image. These two forces are acting on the table simultaneously, creating an interesting visual effect.

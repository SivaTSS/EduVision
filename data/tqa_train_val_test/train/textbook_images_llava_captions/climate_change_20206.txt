In the image, there is a graph showing the temperature of the ocean at different depths. The graph is divided into three sections: the top, middle, and bottom. The top section shows the temperature at the surface of the ocean, while the middle section shows the temperature at a depth of 100 meters. The bottom section shows the temperature at a depth of 300 meters.
There are two arrows in the image, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. The upwards arrow is pointing towards the top section of the graph, while the downwards arrow is pointing towards the bottom section of the graph. This suggests that the temperature increases as one goes deeper into the ocean.

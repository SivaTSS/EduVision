The image depicts a flowchart illustrating the process of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Nitrogen is present in the air in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These compounds are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, in vehicles and power plants.
The flowchart starts with the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) entering the atmosphere. These compounds then react with water vapor in the air to form nitric acid (HNO3) and nitrous acid (HNO2). The nitric acid (HNO3) and nitrous acid (HNO2) combine to form nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) then react with oxygen in the air to form nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The

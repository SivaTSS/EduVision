In the image, there are two main elements: a clock and a compass. The clock is located on the left side of the image, while the compass is positioned on the right side. The compass has the letters N, S, W, and E on it, indicating the cardinal directions. The clock, on the other hand, shows the time as 12:00. The combination of the clock and compass creates a visual representation of time and direction.

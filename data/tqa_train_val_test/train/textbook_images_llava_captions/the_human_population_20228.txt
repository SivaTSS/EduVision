In the image, there is a line graph showing the population of the world from 1950 to 2050. The graph is divided into three sections: past, present, and future. The past section represents the population from 1950 to 2000, while the present section shows the population from 2000 to 2050. The future section predicts the population from 2050 to 2095.
The graph displays a significant increase in population from 1950 to 2000, followed by a slight decline from 2000 to 2050, and finally, an expected rise in population from 2050 to 2095.

In the image, there is a diagram depicting the process of photosynthesis. The main components of the process include sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, and chlorophyll. The diagram illustrates how these components work together to produce energy in the form of glucose and oxygen.
The process starts with sunlight, which is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the plant's leaves. The energy from the sunlight is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then stored in the plant's cells for later use, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the photosynthesis process, highlighting the essential components and their interactions.

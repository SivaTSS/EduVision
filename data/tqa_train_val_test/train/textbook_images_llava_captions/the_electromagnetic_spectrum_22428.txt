The Electromagnetic Spectrum is a visual representation of the various types of electromagnetic radiation, ranging from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency gamma rays. Each type of radiation has a unique wavelength, frequency, and intensity.
In the image, the Electromagnetic Spectrum is depicted as a line graph, with each type of radiation represented by a different colored line. The lines are labeled with the names of the different types of radiation, including radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.
The Electromagnetic Spectrum is an important concept in physics and science, as it helps us understand the nature of electromagnetic radiation and how it interacts with matter.

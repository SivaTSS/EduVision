In the image, there is a blue circle that represents an atom. Inside the circle, there is a small dot that represents the nucleus of the atom. Surrounding the nucleus, there are several smaller blue circles that represent the electrons of the atom. These electrons are arranged in orbits around the nucleus, with some closer to the center of the circle and others further away. The arrangement of the electrons in these orbits determines the properties of the atom, such as its mass, charge, and reactivity.

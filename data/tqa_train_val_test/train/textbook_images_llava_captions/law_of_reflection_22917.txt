In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The diagrams show the difference between reflected rays and incident rays. The reflected rays are shown on the left side of the image, while the incident rays are shown on the right side of the image.
In the reflected rays diagram, the rays are shown coming from the left side of the image, reflecting off a surface, and then returning to the left side. In the incident rays diagram, the rays are shown coming from the right side of the image, passing through a surface, and then continuing to the right side. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the difference between reflected and incident rays.

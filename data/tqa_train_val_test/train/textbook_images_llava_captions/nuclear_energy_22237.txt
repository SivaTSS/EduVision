Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei combine to form a new, heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be harnessed to generate electricity. In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of nuclear fusion.
In the first diagram, there are two purple spheres, one on the left and one on the right side of the image. These spheres represent the two atomic nuclei coming together to form a new, heavier nucleus. The energy released during this process is depicted as a yellow explosion in the middle of the image.
In the second diagram, there are three purple spheres, one on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right side of the image. These spheres represent the fusion of three atomic nuclei to form a new, heavier nucleus. The energy released during this process is depicted as two yellow explosions, one on the left and one on the right side of the image.
Overall, these diagrams provide a visual representation of the process of nuclear fusion and the energy released during the fusion of atomic nuclei.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the chemical structure of isoprene. Isoprene is a natural rubber that is a polymer of isoprene. The diagram illustrates the molecular structure of isoprene, which consists of hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and carbon atoms. The hydrogen atoms are distributed throughout the molecule, while the oxygen atoms and carbon atoms form the backbone of the molecule.
There are several hydrogen atoms in the isoprene molecule, with some located near the center of the molecule and others near the edges. The oxygen atoms are distributed throughout the molecule, with some located near the center and others near the edges. The carbon atoms form the backbone of the molecule, with some located near the center and others near the edges.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the molecular structure of isoprene, highlighting the hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms that make up this natural rubber.

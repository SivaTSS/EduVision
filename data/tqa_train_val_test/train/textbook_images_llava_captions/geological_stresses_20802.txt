In the image, there is a rocky cliff with a blue pole sticking out of it. The pole appears to be a geological measuring tool, such as a tape measure or a ruler, used to measure the height of the cliff or the thickness of the rock layers. The pole is positioned vertically in the middle of the cliff, indicating that it is being used to gather data about the geological features of the area. The presence of the pole suggests that this location might be a site for geological research or exploration.

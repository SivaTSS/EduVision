In the image, there is an illustration of a molecule with the name "Nucleotide" written above it. The molecule is depicted as a three-dimensional structure, and it appears to be a part of a larger molecule.
The molecule is composed of various elements, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. The hydrogen atoms are distributed throughout the molecule, while the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms are more concentrated in specific areas.
In addition to the main molecule, there is a smaller molecule located towards the right side of the main molecule. This smaller molecule is also composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms, and it appears to be connected to the main molecule.
Overall, the image provides a detailed illustration of a complex molecular structure, highlighting the various elements that make up the molecule and their arrangement within the structure.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the Earth's surface. One of the diagrams shows the Earth's crust, while the other shows the Earth's mantle. The Earth's crust is the outermost layer of the Earth's surface, and the mantle is the layer beneath the crust. The diagrams also show the Earth's core, which is the innermost layer of the Earth. The Earth's crust and mantle are separated by the Earth's mantle, and the Earth's core is located beneath the mantle. The diagrams provide a clear view of the Earth's structure and the various layers that make up our planet.

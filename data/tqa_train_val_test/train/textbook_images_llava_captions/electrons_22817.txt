In the image, there is a model of an atomic structure displayed in a circle. The circle is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different element: proton, electron, and neutron. The proton is located in the upper-left quadrant, the electron is in the upper-right quadrant, and the neutron is in the lower-left quadrant.
In the center of the circle, there is a purple ball, which represents the nucleus of an atom. The purple ball is surrounded by three yellow balls, each representing a proton. The yellow balls are positioned around the purple ball, with one in the upper-left quadrant, one in the upper-right quadrant, and one in the lower-right quadrant.
Overall, the image provides a visual representation of an atomic structure, highlighting the protons, electrons, and neutrons that make up an atom's nucleus.

This is a diagram of a DNA molecule. The DNA molecule is composed of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These bases are arranged in a specific sequence to form the DNA double helix. The diagram also shows the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule, which consists of alternating sugar and phosphate groups. The sugar-phosphate backbone is crucial for the stability and structure of the DNA molecule.

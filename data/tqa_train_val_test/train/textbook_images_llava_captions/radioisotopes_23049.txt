This is a periodic table of elements. It shows the atomic number, symbol, and name of each element. The table is divided into two sections, one for metals and the other for non-metals. The metals are on the left side of the table, while the non-metals are on the right side. The elements are arranged in order of their atomic number, with hydrogen being the first element on the left side and uranium being the last element on the right side. Each element has a unique symbol, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, and U for uranium. The table also includes the atomic mass of each element, which is the sum of the protons, neutrons, and electrons in the nucleus of an atom.

In the image, there is a diagram depicting the process of making cooling water. The process begins with the input of hydrogen and oxygen, which are then combined to form water. The water is then cooled, and the cooling water is directed to a vacuum pump, where it is further cooled. Finally, the cooled water is directed to a heat exchanger, where it is heated, and the heated water is returned to the vacuum pump for further cooling. The entire process is depicted in a series of arrows, indicating the flow of the cooling water through the different stages of the process.

In the image, there is a close-up of an amino acid molecule. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they consist of a chain of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. There are 20 different amino acids, and each one has a unique three-dimensional structure.
Amino acids can be classified into two main categories: essential and non-essential. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through the diet. Non-essential amino acids are those that can be synthesized by the body and do not need to be obtained through the diet.
Amino acids play a crucial role in various physiological processes, such as muscle growth and repair, immune system function, and the synthesis of hormones and enzymes. They also serve as precursors for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
In summary, amino acids are the building blocks of

In the image, there is a representation of a heating and cooling system. The main focus is on the air conditioning and heating system, which includes a furnace and an air conditioning unit. The furnace is located on the left side of the image, while the air conditioning unit is situated on the right side.
There are several arrows pointing in different directions, indicating the flow of air through the system. Some of these arrows are pointing towards the furnace, while others are pointing towards the air conditioning unit.

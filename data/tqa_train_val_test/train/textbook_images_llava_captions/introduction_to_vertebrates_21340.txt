In the image, there is a large black snake lying on the ground near a body of water. The snake appears to be resting or possibly preparing to swim in the water. The snake's body occupies a significant portion of the scene, stretching from the left to the right side of the image.
In addition to the snake, there are two birds present in the scene. One bird is located near the top left corner of the image, while the other bird can be seen in the top right corner. The presence of these birds adds an interesting element to the overall composition of the image.

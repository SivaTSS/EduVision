In the image, there are three diagrams illustrating the concept of nuclear fission. The first diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 238, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an unstable uranium-238 nucleus. The second diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 236, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an unstable uranium-236 nucleus. The third diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 235, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an unstable uranium-235 nucleus.
In addition to the diagrams, there are two arrows in the image. One arrow is pointing upwards, and the other arrow is pointing downwards. These arrows are likely used to indicate the process of nuclear fission, where the unstable nucleus splits into two smaller, more stable nuclei.

In the image, there are four diagrams showing the chemical structures of four different sugars. The diagrams are labeled with the names of the sugars: glucose, fructose, galactose, and sucrose. Each of the diagrams illustrates the molecular structure of the respective sugar, providing a visual representation of their chemical makeup. These diagrams can be helpful in understanding the differences between these sugars and their roles in various biological processes.

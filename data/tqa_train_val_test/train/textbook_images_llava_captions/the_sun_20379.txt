In the image, there is a close-up view of a basketball, which is the main focus of the image. Above the basketball, there is a diagram that explains how big the sun is compared to the basketball. The diagram shows that the sun has a diameter of approximately 1.4 million kilometers, which is much larger than the size of the basketball.
The image also includes a few other elements, such as a clock on the right side of the image and a small dot in the middle of the basketball. The presence of these elements adds context to the main focus of the image, which is the comparison of the basketball's size to the sun's size.

In the image, there is a thermocline diagram showing the temperature of the water at different depths. The thermocline is a layer of warm water that sits on top of a colder layer of water. The diagram shows that the temperature of the water increases as it goes deeper into the ocean. The thermocline is an essential part of the ocean's ecosystem and plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the marine environment.

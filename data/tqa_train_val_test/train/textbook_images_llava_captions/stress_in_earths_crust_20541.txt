The image depicts a cross-section of the Earth's crust, showcasing the layers of the Earth's interior. The layers include the mantle, the outer core, the inner core, and the crust. The crust is further divided into the continental crust and the oceanic crust.
In addition to the geological layers, the image also highlights the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's crust. The tectonic plates include the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate, the African Plate, the South American Plate, the Antarctic Plate, and the Indo-Australian Plate.
Furthermore, the image illustrates the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core. The Earth's magnetic field plays a crucial role in protecting the planet from the harmful effects of solar radiation.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the Earth's geological and geophysical features.

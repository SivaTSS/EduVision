In the image, there are two diagrams of the human heart. One of the diagrams is labeled "semilunar valve," while the other is labeled "atrioventricular valve." The diagrams show the different parts of the heart, including the atria, ventricles, and semilunar and atrioventricular valves.
The semilunar valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The atrioventricular valve, also known as the mitral valve, is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. These valves play a crucial role in regulating the flow of blood within the heart.
In addition to the valves, the diagrams also show the different chambers of the heart, such as the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. These chambers work together to pump blood throughout the body.

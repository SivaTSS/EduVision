The human nervous system consists of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body. The PNS is divided into the somatic nervous system, which controls voluntary muscles, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary muscles. The somatic nervous system is further divided into the motor division, which carries messages from the brain to the muscles, and the sensory division, which carries messages from the muscles to the brain. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic division, which controls the body's response to stress, and the parasympathetic division, which controls the body's response to rest and relaxation.

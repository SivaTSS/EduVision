In the image, there is a wooden chest and a barbell next to each other. The wooden chest is placed on the left side of the image, while the barbell is on the right side. The wooden chest is quite large, occupying a significant portion of the left side of the image. The barbell, on the other hand, is much smaller in comparison, occupying only a small portion of the right side of the image.

In the image, there are three diagrams illustrating the concept of nuclear fission. The first diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 238, which is the atomic number of uranium-238, the most common isotope of uranium. The second diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 235, which is the atomic number of uranium-235, a fissionable isotope of uranium. The third diagram shows a yellow circle with the number 233, which is the atomic number of uranium-233, another fissionable isotope of uranium.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the concept of nuclear fission, which is the process by which the nucleus of an atom splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing energy in the form of heat and radiation. The diagrams show the importance of uranium-238, uranium-235, and uranium-233 in the process of nuclear fission.

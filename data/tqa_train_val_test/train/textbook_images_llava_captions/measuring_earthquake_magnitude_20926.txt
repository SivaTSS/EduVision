In the image, there is a graph displaying two different types of waves. The first wave is labeled "S-Wave," and the second wave is labeled "P-Wave." The S-Wave appears to be a smaller wave, while the P-Wave is a larger wave.
The graph is divided into two sections, with the S-Wave on the left side and the P-Wave on the right side. The S-Wave starts at the top left corner of the graph, while the P-Wave starts at the top right corner of the graph. The S-Wave reaches its peak at the bottom left corner of the graph, while the P-Wave reaches its peak at the bottom right corner of the graph.

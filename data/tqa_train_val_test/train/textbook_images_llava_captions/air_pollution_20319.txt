In the image, there are two large smokestacks emitting a significant amount of smoke. The smoke is billowing out of the tops of the smokestacks, creating a pinkish hue in the sky. The smokestacks are located next to each other, and the smoke appears to be coming from both of them. The scene is set against a backdrop of a cloudy sky, which adds to the overall atmosphere of the image.

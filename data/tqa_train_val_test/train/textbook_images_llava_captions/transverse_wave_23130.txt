In the image, there is a black and white diagram that illustrates the concept of crests and troughs. The crests represent the highest and lowest points of a wave, while the troughs represent the lowest and highest points of a wave. The crests and troughs are labeled with the words "crests" and "troughs," respectively.
The diagram is divided into three sections. The first section is on the left side of the image, the second section is in the middle, and the third section is on the right side of the image. Each section is labeled with the words "left," "middle," and "right," respectively.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the concept of crests and troughs in the context of waves.

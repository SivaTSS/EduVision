In the image, there is a detailed illustration of the human heart and its various components. The heart is depicted in the center of the image, surrounded by a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.
The illustration highlights the cardiac muscle, which is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, as well as the epicardium, which is the outermost layer of the heart. Additionally, the image shows the pericardium, which is the fibrous sac surrounding the heart, and the lining of the heart, known as the endocardium.
The illustration also provides information about the blood vessels, such as the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body, and the pulmonary vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. Furthermore, the illustration includes details about the heart's chambers, such as the left atrium and the right atrium, as well as the left ventricle and the right ventricle, which are responsible for pumping blood into the lungs and the rest of the body, respectively.

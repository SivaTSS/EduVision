In the image, there is a close-up view of a DNA double helix structure. The double helix is composed of two intertwined strands of DNA. The strands are made up of repeating units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
In this particular image, the double helix is made up of blue and black beads. The blue beads represent the sugar molecules, while the black beads represent the phosphate groups. The nitrogenous bases are not visible in the image, but their presence is implied by the overall structure of the double helix.
The close-up view of the double helix allows for a better understanding of its intricate structure and the role it plays in storing and transmitting genetic information.

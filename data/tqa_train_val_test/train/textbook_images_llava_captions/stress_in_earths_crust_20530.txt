In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first one is a black and white drawing of a cliff face, depicting the layers of the rock formation. The second one is a photograph of the same cliff face, providing a real-life view of the rocky terrain.
In the drawing, there are several birds scattered throughout the scene, adding a touch of life to the otherwise barren landscape. The birds are positioned at various heights and distances from the cliff face, creating a sense of depth and movement in the image.

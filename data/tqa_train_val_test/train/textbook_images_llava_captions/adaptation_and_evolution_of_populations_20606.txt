In the image, there is a tree-like diagram that illustrates the process of mutation and reproduction. The tree is divided into three main sections: mutation, variation, and reproduction.
In the mutation section, there are three circles, each representing a different stage of mutation. The first circle is located on the left side of the tree, the second circle is in the middle, and the third circle is on the right side.
In the variation section, there are four circles, each representing a different stage of variation. The first circle is located on the left side of the tree, the second circle is in the middle, the third circle is on the right side, and the fourth circle is at the bottom of the tree.
In the reproduction section, there are five circles, each representing a different stage of reproduction. The first circle is located on the left side of the tree, the second circle is in the middle, the third circle is on the right side, the fourth circle is at the bottom of the tree, and the fifth circle is at the top of the tree.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the Earth's magnetic field. The first diagram shows the Earth's magnetic field as it would appear to someone standing at the North Pole. The second diagram shows the Earth's magnetic field as it would appear to someone standing at the South Pole.
In both diagrams, the magnetic field is represented by arrows pointing in various directions. The arrows indicate the strength and direction of the magnetic field at different points on the Earth's surface. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the Earth's magnetic field and how it varies across the globe.

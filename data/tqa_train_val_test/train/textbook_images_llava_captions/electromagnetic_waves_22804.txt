In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the concept of electric field lines. The first diagram shows the electric field lines for a positive charge, while the second diagram shows the electric field lines for a negative charge.
In the first diagram, the electric field lines are concentrated around the positive charge, creating a dense cluster of lines. In the second diagram, the electric field lines are dispersed around the negative charge, forming a more spread-out pattern.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the concept of electric field lines and how they are affected by the presence of positive and negative charges.

In the image, there is a detailed illustration of a water filtration system. The main components of the system include a water tank, a filtration system, a coagulation system, a sedimentation system, and a disinfection system.
The water tank is connected to the filtration system through a series of pipes. The filtration system is responsible for removing impurities and contaminants from the water. The coagulation system helps to remove suspended solids from the water, while the sedimentation system settles the solids to the bottom of the tank. Finally, the disinfection system ensures that the water is free from harmful bacteria and other pathogens.
In addition to these main components, there are also smaller illustrations of a house, a greenhouse, and a water tower. These smaller illustrations help to provide context to the overall water filtration system.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum is a visual representation of the various types of electromagnetic waves that exist in the universe. These waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Each type of wave has a specific frequency and wavelength, which determines its properties and how it interacts with matter.
In the image, the Electromagnetic Spectrum is depicted as a curved line, with each type of wave represented by a different color or symbol. The line starts with radio waves on the left side, followed by microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays on the right side. This visual representation provides a clear understanding of the different types of electromagnetic waves and their unique characteristics.

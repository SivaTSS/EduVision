In the image, there is a series of diagrams illustrating the process of a cell dividing. The diagrams show a cell dividing into three smaller cells. The first cell is located on the left side of the image, the second cell is in the middle, and the third cell is on the right side of the image.
In addition to the cell dividing diagrams, there are three arrows pointing in different directions. The first arrow is on the left side of the image, the second arrow is in the middle, and the third arrow is on the right side of the image. These arrows likely represent the movement of the cells during the division process.

The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the ocean floor, showcasing various features such as the continental shelf, oceanic trench, and mid-oceanic ridge. The continental shelf is a gently sloping area that extends from the shore to the edge of the continental plate. The oceanic trench is a deep, narrow depression in the floor of the ocean, formed by the collision of two tectonic plates. The mid-oceanic ridge is a volcanic ridge that runs along the center of the ocean floor, marking the boundary between the two tectonic plates.
In addition to these major features, the image also highlights the continental rise, which is the steepest part of the continental shelf, and the abyssal plain, which is the deepest and flattest part of the ocean floor.

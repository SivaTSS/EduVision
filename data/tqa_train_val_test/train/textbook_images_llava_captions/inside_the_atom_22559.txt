In the image, there is a representation of an atom's protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are located in the center of the atom, while the electrons are scattered around them. The protons are positively charged, the neutrons are neutral, and the electrons are negatively charged.
There are six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons in the image. The protons and neutrons are positioned in the center of the atom, while the electrons are spread out around them. This diagram provides a visual representation of an atom's structure and the distribution of its protons, neutrons, and electrons.

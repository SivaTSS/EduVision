In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between temperature and atmospheric pressure. The y-axis represents the atmospheric pressure, while the x-axis shows the temperature in degrees Celsius.
The graph is divided into several sections, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to about 7 to 16 kilometers (4 to 10 miles) above sea level. The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere, extending from about 16 to 50 kilometers (10 to 31 miles) above sea level. The mesosphere is the layer between the stratosphere and the thermosphere, extending from about 50 to 85 kilometers (31 to 53 miles) above sea level. Finally, the thermosphere is the highest layer of the atmosphere, extending from about 85 to 600 kilometers (53 to 373 miles) above sea level.

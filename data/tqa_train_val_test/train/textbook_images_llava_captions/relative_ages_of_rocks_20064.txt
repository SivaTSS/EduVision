The image depicts a spiral-shaped diagram that illustrates the evolution of life on Earth. The spiral is divided into several sections, each representing a different era in the history of life on Earth. The sections are labeled with the names of the eras, such as "Precambrian," "Cambrian," "Ordovician," "Silurian," "Devonian," "Carboniferous," "Permian," "Triassic," "Jurassic," "Cretaceous," "Paleogene," and "Neogene."
Within each section, various types of animals are depicted, showcasing the diversity of life throughout the different eras. Some of the animals include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the progression of life on Earth, from the earliest forms of life in the Precambrian era to the most recent forms of life in the Neogene era.

The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, showcasing the various layers of the planet. The layers include the outer core, inner core, mantle, and crust. The outer core is located at the center of the Earth and is composed of liquid iron and nickel. The inner core is a solid ball of iron and nickel, surrounded by the outer core. The mantle is the layer between the outer core and the crust, and it is primarily composed of rock. Finally, the crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, consisting of the tectonic plates that make up the Earth's surface.
In addition to the Earth's interior, the image also includes a diagram of the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is divided into the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. The troposphere is the layer closest to the Earth's surface and contains most of the Earth's weather systems. The stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere are progressively higher layers of the atmosphere, with the thermosphere being the highest layer.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive

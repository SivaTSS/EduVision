In the image, there are four diagrams, each depicting a different mechanical advantage. The diagrams are labeled IMA 1, IMA 2, IMA 3, and IMA 4.
The first diagram, IMA 1, shows a pulley system with a rope and a wheel. The second diagram, IMA 2, illustrates a wheelbarrow with a rope and a wheel. The third diagram, IMA 3, displays a seesaw with a rope and a wheel. Lastly, the fourth diagram, IMA 4, presents a hockey stick with a rope and a wheel.
Each of these diagrams demonstrates a different mechanical advantage, showcasing how the use of pulleys, wheels, and ropes can make tasks easier and more efficient.

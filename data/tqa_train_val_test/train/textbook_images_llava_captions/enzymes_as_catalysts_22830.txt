In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of how an enzyme works. The diagrams show the active site of an enzyme and the active site of an enzyme with a substrate. The active site is the part of the enzyme that binds to the substrate during the enzyme's function.
In the first diagram, the active site of an enzyme is shown without a substrate. In the second diagram, the active site of an enzyme with a substrate is depicted. The presence of the substrate in the second diagram highlights the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate during the enzyme's function.

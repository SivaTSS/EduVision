In the image, there is a cloud with lightning bolts inside of it. Below the cloud, there is a diagram explaining the process of discharge between the negative base of a cloud and the positive top of a cloud. The diagram also shows the area between the two clouds, which is referred to as the intercloud.
There are multiple lightning bolts scattered throughout the image, with some closer to the top of the cloud and others closer to the bottom of the cloud. These lightning bolts help illustrate the concept of discharge between the negative and positive areas of a cloud.

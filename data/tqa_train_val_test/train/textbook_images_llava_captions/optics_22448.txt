In the image, there is a reflection of an object in a mirror. The mirror is placed at a focal point, which is closer to the object than the focal point of the image. The distance between the focal point of the mirror and the focal point of the image is equal to the distance between the mirror's focal point and the image's focal point. The distance between the mirror's focal point and the object is also equal to the distance between the image's focal point and the mirror's focal point. The distance between the mirror's focal point and the object is also equal to the distance between the image's focal point and the mirror's focal point. The distance between the mirror's focal point and the object is also equal to the distance between the image's focal point and the mirror's focal point. The distance between the mirror's focal point and the object is also equal to the distance between the image's focal point and the mirror's focal point. The distance between the mirror's focal point and the object is also equal to the distance between the image's focal point and the mirror

In the image, there is a detailed illustration of the human body, focusing on the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS includes all the nerves that extend from the CNS to the rest of the body.
The illustration is divided into three main sections: the brain, the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system. The brain is depicted in the upper part of the image, while the spinal cord is shown in the middle section. The peripheral nervous system is depicted in the lower part of the image.
In addition to the main sections, there are several smaller illustrations scattered throughout the image. These smaller illustrations likely represent different parts of the CNS and PNS. Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the human body's central and peripheral nervous systems.

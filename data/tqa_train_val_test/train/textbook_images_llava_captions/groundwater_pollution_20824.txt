In the image, there are two large black cylindrical objects, which appear to be tanks or pipes. One of the tanks is located on the left side of the image, while the other is on the right side. Both tanks are filled with a black substance, which seems to be a mixture of dirt and water.
In addition to the tanks, there is a truck visible in the background on the right side of the image. The presence of the truck suggests that it might be involved in the transportation or handling of the black substance in the tanks.

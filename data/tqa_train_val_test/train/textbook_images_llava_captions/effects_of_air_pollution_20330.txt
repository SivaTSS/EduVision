The image depicts a diagram showing the relationship between UV radiation and ozone in the atmosphere. There are two main diagrams in the image, with the first one focusing on the relationship between UV radiation and ozone, and the second one showing the relationship between ozone and UV radiation.
In the first diagram, there is a line representing UV radiation, and another line representing ozone. The line for ozone is positioned above the line for UV radiation, indicating a positive relationship between the two.
In the second diagram, there is a line representing ozone, and another line representing UV radiation. The line for UV radiation is positioned below the line for ozone, indicating a negative relationship between the two.
In both diagrams, there are arrows pointing from one line to the other, indicating the direction of the relationship between UV radiation and ozone. Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the relationship between UV radiation and ozone in the atmosphere.

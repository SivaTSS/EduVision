In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each representing a different wave length. The first wave length diagram is blue, while the second one is green. The diagrams showcase the differences between the two wave lengths, with the blue wave length being longer than the green one.
Both diagrams are accompanied by labels, with the blue wave length labeled as "wavelength" and the green wave length labeled as "wavelength." The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the differences between the two wave lengths.

In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the chemical structures of two different substances. The first substance is labeled as "butane," and the second substance is labeled as "butane-2." The diagrams show the molecular structure of each substance, with the atoms arranged in a three-dimensional manner.
In the first substance, butane, the molecular structure consists of a chain of four carbon atoms, with two hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon atom. In the second substance, butane-2, the molecular structure also consists of a chain of four carbon atoms, with two hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon atom. However, butane-2 has an additional methyl group attached to one of the carbon atoms, making it slightly different from butane.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the molecular structures of these two substances, highlighting their similarities and differences.

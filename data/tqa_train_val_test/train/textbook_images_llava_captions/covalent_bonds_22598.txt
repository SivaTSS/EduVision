The image depicts a molecular model of an oxygen molecule. The oxygen molecule is composed of two oxygen atoms, which are connected by a double bond. The double bond is represented by a yellow line that connects the two oxygen atoms.
In addition to the oxygen molecule, there are several other molecules present in the image. These include a nitrogen molecule, a carbon dioxide molecule, and a water molecule. The nitrogen molecule is represented by a blue line, the carbon dioxide molecule is represented by a purple line, and the water molecule is represented by a green line.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the molecular structure of an oxygen molecule and its interactions with other molecules.

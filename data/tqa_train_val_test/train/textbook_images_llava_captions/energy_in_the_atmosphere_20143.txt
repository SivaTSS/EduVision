The image depicts two diagrams side by side, each illustrating the effects of natural and human-enhanced greenhouse gases on Earth's climate. The natural greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), and oxygen (O2), while the human-enhanced greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases (F-gases).
In the natural greenhouse gases diagram, there are arrows pointing upwards, indicating that these gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming. On the other hand, in the human-enhanced greenhouse gases diagram, the arrows point downwards, signifying that these gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, exacerbating global warming.
The diagrams also highlight the differences between natural and human-enhanced greenhouse gases. While natural greenhouse gases are essential for life on Earth, human-enhanced greenhouse gases are primarily the result of

In the image, there is a blue line and a red line running parallel to each other. The blue line represents the distance between two particles of matter, while the red line represents the kinetic energy of particles of matter. The two lines are running parallel to each other, indicating that the kinetic energy of particles of matter is related to the distance between them.

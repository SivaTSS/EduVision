The image depicts a timeline of the Earth's history, starting with the formation of the planet and ending with the present day. The timeline is divided into several sections, each representing a different era in Earth's history.
The first section, labeled "Cenozoic Era," spans from 65 million years ago to the present day. The second section, "Tertiary Period," covers the time from 65 million years ago to 2.6 million years ago. The third section, "Quaternary Period," covers the time from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago. The fourth section, "Holocene Epoch," covers the time from 11,700 years ago to the present day.
In addition to these sections, the timeline also includes labels for specific time periods, such as the "Pleistocene Epoch," which spans from 11,700 years ago to 2.6 million years ago, and the "Holocene Epoch," which spans from 11,700 years ago to the present day.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram is a representation of an electric field, while the second one is a representation of a magnetic field.
The electric field diagram consists of multiple arrows pointing in various directions, indicating the strength and direction of the electric field at different points. The magnetic field diagram, on the other hand, features a similar arrangement of arrows, but they represent the strength and direction of the magnetic field instead.
Both diagrams are labeled with the term "Electric Field" and "Magnetic Field" to clearly distinguish between the two types of fields.

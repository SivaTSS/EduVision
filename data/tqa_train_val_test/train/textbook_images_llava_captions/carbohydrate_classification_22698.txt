The image depicts a cellulose fiber, which is a type of cellulose molecule. The cellulose fiber is made up of long chains of cellulose molecules that are intertwined with each other. The cellulose molecules are arranged in a spiral pattern, giving the cellulose fiber its unique structure.
In addition to the cellulose fiber, the image also shows a cellulose molecule. The cellulose molecule is smaller in size compared to the cellulose fiber. The cellulose molecule is also made up of long chains of cellulose molecules that are intertwined with each other. However, the arrangement of the cellulose molecules in the cellulose molecule is different from the arrangement in the cellulose fiber.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the cellulose fiber and cellulose molecule, showcasing their unique structures and intertwined chains of cellulose molecules.

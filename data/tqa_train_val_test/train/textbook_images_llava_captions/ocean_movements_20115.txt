Bay of Fundy Tides:
In the image, there are several boats docked in the harbor. Some of the boats are docked close to each other, while others are spaced further apart. There are also a few people visible in the scene, likely enjoying the view or attending to their boats.
In addition to the boats and people, there are two clocks present in the image. One clock is located near the center of the scene, while the other clock is positioned towards the right side of the image. The presence of these clocks suggests that the area might be a popular spot for boat owners and visitors to keep track of time while they are in the harbor.

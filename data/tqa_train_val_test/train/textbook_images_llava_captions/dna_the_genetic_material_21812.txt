In the image, there is a close-up view of a DNA double helix structure. The double helix is composed of two intertwined strands of DNA, with each strand consisting of four nucleotides. These nucleotides are arranged in a specific sequence, which determines the genetic information stored in the DNA.
The double helix is depicted in various colors, such as blue, orange, and red, which represent the different nucleotide bases. These colors are used to differentiate between the four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
In addition to the main double helix structure, there are smaller representations of the double helix scattered throughout the image, emphasizing the complexity and intricacy of the DNA molecule.

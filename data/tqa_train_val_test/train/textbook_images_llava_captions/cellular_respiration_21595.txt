In the image, there is a diagram showing the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a metabolic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA into citrate through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The electron transport chain, on the other hand, is a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane that transfer electrons from one molecule to another, generating a proton gradient that powers the synthesis of ATP.
In the diagram, the Krebs cycle is depicted on the left side of the image, while the electron transport chain is shown on the right side. The two pathways are interconnected, with the Krebs cycle producing acetyl-CoA, which is then transferred to the electron transport chain to generate ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation.

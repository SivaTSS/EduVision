In the image, there is a diagram that explains the concept of a vibrating charged particle left (or right) of an electromagnetic wave. The electromagnetic wave is represented by an orange line, while the charged particle is depicted by a green line. The diagram also shows the direction of the electromagnetic wave and the movement of the charged particle.
In addition to the main diagram, there are two smaller diagrams, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the main diagram. These smaller diagrams likely provide more detailed information about the concepts being explained in the main diagram. Overall, the image presents a clear and concise explanation of the relationship between a vibrating charged particle and an electromagnetic wave.

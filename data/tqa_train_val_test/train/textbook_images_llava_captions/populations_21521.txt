In the image, there is a graph showing the number of individuals over time. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis shows the number of individuals. The graph is divided into three sections: A, B, and C.
Section A shows the number of individuals at the beginning of the time period. Section B shows the number of individuals at the peak of the time period. Section C shows the number of individuals at the end of the time period.
In addition to the main graph, there are two smaller graphs on the right side of the main graph. The first smaller graph shows the number of individuals at the peak of the time period, while the second smaller graph shows the number of individuals at the end of the time period.
Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the number of individuals over time, highlighting the peak and the end of the time period.

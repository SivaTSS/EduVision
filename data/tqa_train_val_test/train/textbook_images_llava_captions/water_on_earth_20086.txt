In the image, there is a pie chart showing the distribution of the world's water. The chart is divided into four sections, each representing a different type of water: freshwater, saltwater, ice caps and glaciers, and accessible surface water.
Freshwater is the largest portion of the pie chart, making up about 60% of the world's water. Saltwater, including oceans and seas, accounts for about 30% of the world's water. Ice caps and glaciers represent about 10% of the world's water, while accessible surface water, which includes lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, makes up the remaining 10% of the pie chart.

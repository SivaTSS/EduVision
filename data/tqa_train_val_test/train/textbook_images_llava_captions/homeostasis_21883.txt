In the image, there is a purple flowchart that illustrates the process of negative feedback in the body. The flowchart is divided into four main sections: receptor, brain sense change, negative feedback signal, and response leads to a decrease in body temperature.
The flowchart starts with the receptor, which is responsible for detecting changes in the body's environment. The receptor then sends a signal to the brain, which processes the information and initiates a response. The response leads to a decrease in body temperature, which helps regulate the body's temperature and maintain homeostasis.
Overall, the flowchart provides a clear and concise representation of the negative feedback process in the body.

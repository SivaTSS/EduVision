The image displays a detailed diagram of the human heart, showcasing its various components and functions. The heart is divided into four chambers: the left atrium, the left ventricle, the right atrium, and the right ventricle. These chambers work together to pump blood throughout the body.
In addition to the chambers, the diagram highlights the pulmonary vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium, and the pulmonary artery, which transports deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
Furthermore, the diagram illustrates the aorta, which is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the rest of the body, and the vena cava, which collects deoxygenated blood from the body's extremities and returns it to the right atrium.

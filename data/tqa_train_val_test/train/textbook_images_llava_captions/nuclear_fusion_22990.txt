In the image, there is a detailed diagram of a fusion reactor. The reactor consists of several components, including a helium bled pipe, a neutron source, and a heat exchanger. The helium bled pipe is connected to the neutron source, and the heat exchanger is responsible for transferring heat from the fusion reactor to a heat sink.
The fusion reactor is designed to produce heat by fusing hydrogen atoms into helium. This process releases a significant amount of energy, which can be harnessed for various purposes, such as generating electricity or powering spacecraft. The diagram provides a clear understanding of the components and their functions within the fusion reactor.

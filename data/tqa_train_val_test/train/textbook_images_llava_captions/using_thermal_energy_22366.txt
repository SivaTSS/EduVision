In the image, there is a diagram depicting a gas-fired boiler and a radiator. The boiler is connected to the radiator through a series of pipes and valves. The radiator is responsible for distributing the heat generated by the boiler to the surrounding area.
There are several arrows in the diagram, indicating the flow of water and heat through the system. The arrows show the movement of water from the boiler to the radiator, as well as the transfer of heat from the boiler to the radiator.
In addition to the boiler and radiator, there is a fireplace present in the scene. The fireplace appears to be connected to the boiler, suggesting that the heat generated by the fireplace could be used to heat the water in the boiler.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the gas-fired boiler and radiator system, highlighting the connections and interactions between the various components.

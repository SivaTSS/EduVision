In the image, there is a large pile of dirt with a mountain in the background. The pile of dirt appears to be a construction site, and there are several trucks parked around the area. Some of the trucks are closer to the pile of dirt, while others are further away.
In addition to the trucks, there are two people visible in the scene. One person is located near the left side of the image, and the other person is on the right side, closer to the pile of dirt. The presence of these individuals suggests that they might be working at the construction site or monitoring the progress of the project.

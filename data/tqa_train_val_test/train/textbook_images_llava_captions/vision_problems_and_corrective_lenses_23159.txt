The image also shows the optic nerve, which is the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain.
In addition to the close-up view of the eye, there is a diagram showing a cross-section of the eye. The cross-section illustrates the different layers of the eye, including the cornea, iris, ciliary body, lens, retina, and optic nerve.

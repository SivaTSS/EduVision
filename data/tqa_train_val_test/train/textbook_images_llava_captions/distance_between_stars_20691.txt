In the image, there is a drawing of a parallax motion on a white background. The parallax motion refers to the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from different angles. The drawing illustrates the concept of the parallax angle, which is the angle formed between the line of sight and the line perpendicular to the line of sight.
There are several labels on the drawing, including "Parallax Motion," "Parallax Angle," "Near Star," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Parallax Angle," "Par

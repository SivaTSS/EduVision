In the image, there is a black and white graph showing the direction of a wave in a spring. The wave is depicted as a series of zig-zag lines, indicating the direction of the wave. The graph is divided into two sections, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The left side of the graph shows the direction of the wave, while the right side shows the direction of the wave in a spring. The graph provides a clear visual representation of the wave's movement, making it easier to understand and analyze.

The image depicts a polar bond in a water molecule. The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms (H) and one oxygen atom (O). The oxygen atom is located at the center of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms are positioned on either side of the oxygen atom, forming a polar bond. The polar bond results from the difference in electronegativity between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, with the oxygen atom having a higher electronegativity than the hydrogen atoms. This difference in electronegativity leads to the formation of a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atoms, resulting in the polar bond.

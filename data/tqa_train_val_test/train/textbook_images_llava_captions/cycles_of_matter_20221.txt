In the image, there is a map of the United States with a blue line running through the middle of it. This blue line represents the Mississippi River, which runs from the Gulf of Mexico in the south to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the north. Along the river, there is a green swampy area, which appears to be a dead zone in the Mississippi River.
In addition to the map, there is a picture of a swampy area next to the Mississippi River. The swampy area is surrounded by trees, giving it a lush and green appearance. The combination of the map and the picture provides a visual representation of the Mississippi River and its surroundings.

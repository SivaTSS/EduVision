In the image, there is a small model of the Earth suspended in mid-air. The Earth model is located in the center of the scene, and it appears to be the main focus of the image.
In addition to the Earth model, there are two other objects in the scene. One object is located on the left side of the Earth model, and the other object is on the right side. Both of these objects are smaller than the Earth model, and they seem to be part of the overall composition of the image.

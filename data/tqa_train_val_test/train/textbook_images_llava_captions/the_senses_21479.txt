In the image, there is a close-up view of a human eye. The eye is divided into three sections, with each section showing a different part of the eye. The first section shows the cornea, the second section shows the iris and pupil, and the third section shows the retina.
In addition to the eye, there are three arrows pointing towards the eye. These arrows are labeled with the words "myopia," "hyperopia," and "corrected." This suggests that the image may be used for educational purposes or to demonstrate the differences between normal vision, myopia (nearsightedness), and hyperopia (farsightedness) and how they can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.

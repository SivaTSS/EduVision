In the image, there are two diagrams displayed side by side. The diagrams showcase the process of magnetization. One of the diagrams is a black and white image, while the other is a color image.
In the black and white image, there are several arrows pointing in different directions. These arrows represent the movement of the magnetic field during the process of magnetization. The color image, on the other hand, provides a more detailed view of the magnetization process.
In both diagrams, the main focus is on the movement of the magnetic field and how it interacts with the material being magnetized. Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the magnetization process.

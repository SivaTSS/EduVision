In the image, there is a black and white diagram depicting the buoyant force and sinking force in a body of water. The buoyant force is represented by a pink circle, while the sinking force is represented by an orange circle. The diagram shows the relationship between these two forces, with the buoyant force acting in the opposite direction of the sinking force. The pink circle is positioned above the orange circle, indicating that the buoyant force is stronger than the sinking force. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the concept of buoyant force and sinking force in a body of water.

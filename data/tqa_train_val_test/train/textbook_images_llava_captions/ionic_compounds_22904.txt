In the image, there is a close-up view of a crystal of sodium chloride. The crystal is made up of many small cubes, each containing a single sodium ion and a single chloride ion. The sodium and chloride ions are arranged in a three-dimensional lattice structure, with the sodium ions occupying the corners of the cubes and the chloride ions occupying the centers of the cubes. The close-up view highlights the intricate details of the crystal structure and the arrangement of the ions within it.

In the image, there is a close-up of a person's mouth with a tooth missing, as well as an x-ray of the same person's mouth. The x-ray clearly shows the missing tooth, while the close-up of the person's mouth reveals the empty space where the tooth used to be.
In addition to the x-ray and the close-up of the person's mouth, there is an image of an airport on the right side of the image.

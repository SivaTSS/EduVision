In the image, there is a person holding onto a pole with an American flag hanging from it. The person is wearing a red shirt and appears to be lifting the flag. There is also a hammer in the scene, which is located near the top left corner of the image. The hammer seems to be the main focus of the image, with the person and the flag serving as secondary elements.

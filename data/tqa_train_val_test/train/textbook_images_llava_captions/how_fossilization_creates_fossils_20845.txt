In the image, there is a large brown bear walking across a grassy field. The bear is positioned towards the right side of the image. In the background, there are several birds scattered throughout the scene. Some of the birds can be seen flying in the sky, while others are perched on the ground.
In addition to the bear and birds, there is a herd of elephants present in the scene. The elephants are spread out across the field, with some closer to the left side of the image and others further to the right. The combination of the bear, birds, and elephants creates a dynamic and lively atmosphere in the image.

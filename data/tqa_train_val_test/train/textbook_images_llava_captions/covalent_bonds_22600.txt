In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The diagrams depict the process of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the human body.
On the left side of the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the human body. The process starts with the inhalation of oxygen (O2) into the lungs, followed by the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide (CO2) is then transported to the lungs, where it is exhaled out of the body.

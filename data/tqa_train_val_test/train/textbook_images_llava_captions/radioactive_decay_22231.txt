In the image, there is a bar graph showing the number of days it takes for radioactive decay to occur. The x-axis represents the number of days, while the y-axis shows the amount of radioactive decay. There are three bars in the graph, each representing a different type of radioactive decay.
The first bar, located on the left side of the graph, represents alpha decay. The second bar, in the middle of the graph, represents beta decay. The third bar, on the right side of the graph, represents gamma decay. Each bar has a different height, indicating the varying decay rates for each type of radioactive decay.

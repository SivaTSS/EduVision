The image displays four different patterns of population distribution: Clumped, Random, Uniform, and Uniform Clumped. Each pattern is represented by a different color, with Clumped being red, Random being blue, Uniform being green, and Uniform Clumped being a combination of red and green.
In the Clumped pattern, the population is concentrated in specific areas, while in the Random pattern, the population is dispersed randomly throughout the area. The Uniform pattern shows a consistent distribution of the population across the area, and the Uniform Clumped pattern combines elements of both the Uniform and Clumped patterns.

In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram shows the process of energy production, while the second diagram illustrates the process of chemical reactions.
In the energy production diagram, there are three main stages: energy absorbed, energy stored, and energy released. The process starts with the absorption of energy from various sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, or fossil fuels. This energy is then stored in batteries or other energy storage devices. Finally, the stored energy is released to power homes, vehicles, and other appliances.

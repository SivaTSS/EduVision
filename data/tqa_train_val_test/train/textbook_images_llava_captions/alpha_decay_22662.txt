In the image, there is a close-up of a proton and a neutron. The proton is located on the left side of the image, while the neutron is on the right side. The proton appears to be larger than the neutron, as it occupies a larger portion of the image.
In addition to the proton and neutron, there is a small blue circle in the middle of the image, which could be a representation of an electron or another subatomic particle. However, it is important to note that the main focus of the image is on the proton and the neutron.

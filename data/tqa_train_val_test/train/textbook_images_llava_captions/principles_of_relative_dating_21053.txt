In the image, there is a large rock with a crack in it. The crack is labeled with the letters A, B, and B. There is also a hammer sticking out of the side of the rock. The rock appears to be made of marble, and the hammer is positioned in such a way that it could be used to break off a piece of the rock. The presence of the letters A, B, and B suggests that the rock might be part of a geological study or demonstration.

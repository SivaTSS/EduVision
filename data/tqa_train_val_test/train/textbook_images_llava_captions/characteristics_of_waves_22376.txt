In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the motion of a rock. The rock is shown to be in motion, traveling through the air. The motion of the rock is described as a series of waves, with each wave representing a different stage of the rock's motion.
The diagram is divided into three sections, each representing a different stage of the rock's motion. The first section shows the rock at rest, the second section shows the rock in motion, and the third section shows the rock traveling through the air. The rock's motion is described as a series of waves, with each wave representing a different stage of the rock's motion.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the rock's motion and the different stages it goes through during its travel through the air.

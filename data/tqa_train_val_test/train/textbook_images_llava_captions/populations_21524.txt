In the image, there is a graph showing the stages of the demographic transition. The stages are labeled as stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, stage 5, and stage 6. Each stage represents a different stage of the demographic transition, with stage 1 being the first stage and stage 6 being the last stage.
The demographic transition refers to the shift in the age distribution of a population over time. This shift can occur due to various factors, such as changes in fertility rates, life expectancy, and migration patterns. The graph in the image provides a visual representation of the stages of the demographic transition, making it easier to understand and analyze the data.

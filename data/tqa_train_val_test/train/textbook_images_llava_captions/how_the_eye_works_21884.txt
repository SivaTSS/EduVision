The image is a detailed diagram of the human eye. It shows the different parts of the eye, such as the iris, ciliary muscle, choroid, vitreous humor, retina, and optic nerve. The iris is the colored part of the eye, and the ciliary muscle is responsible for adjusting the shape of the lens. The choroid is the middle layer of the eye, and the vitreous humor is the jelly-like substance that fills the eye. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, and the optic nerve is the nerve that carries signals from the eye to the brain.

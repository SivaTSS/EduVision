In the image, there are three diagrams illustrating different stages of a flood. The first diagram shows a stream at flood stage, with large particles along its banks. The second diagram depicts the deposition of these large particles, forming natural levees. The third and final diagram shows the aftermath of the flood, where the natural levees have been built up along the stream.
Each of the three diagrams is accompanied by a caption, providing additional information about the stages of the flood. Overall, the image effectively conveys the progression of a flood and its impact on the environment.

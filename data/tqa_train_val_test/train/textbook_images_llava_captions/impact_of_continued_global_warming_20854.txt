The image depicts a graph showing the global fossil carbon emissions from 1900 to 2010. The graph is divided into several sections, each representing a different type of fossil fuel. The sections include natural gas, oil, coal, cement, and gas flaring.
The graph shows a significant increase in fossil carbon emissions over the years, with a noticeable spike in the 1950s and 1960s. The emissions have gradually decreased since the 1970s, with a notable drop in the 1990s and 2000s. The overall trend of the graph indicates a decline in fossil carbon emissions over time.

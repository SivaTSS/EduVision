The image depicts a detailed diagram of the Earth's ecosystem, focusing on the relationship between the atmosphere, oceans, and land. The diagram is divided into three main sections: the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land.
In the atmosphere section, there is a representation of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), and ozone (O3). These gases play a crucial role in the Earth's climate, with CO2 being the most significant contributor to global warming.
In the oceans section, the diagram highlights the importance of marine life, such as plankton, algae, and coral reefs. These organisms contribute to the overall health of the oceans and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem.
In the land section, the diagram showcases various land-based ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. These ecosystems support a wide range of plant and animal species, and they are essential for maintaining the Earth's

In the image, there are two diagrams, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. Both diagrams depict the structure of an atom, showing the protons, electrons, and neutrons. The diagrams are labeled with various elements, such as hydrogen (H), carbon (C), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N).
In the left diagram, the protons are concentrated in the center, while the electrons and neutrons are distributed around them. In the right diagram, the protons are also concentrated in the center, with the electrons and neutrons positioned around them. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the atomic structure and the distribution of protons, electrons, and neutrons within an atom.

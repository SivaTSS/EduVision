In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between the crest of a wave and its wavelength. The x-axis represents the wavelength of the wave, while the y-axis shows the crest of the wave. The curve of the graph illustrates how the crest of the wave changes as the wavelength increases or decreases. The graph provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between the crest and the wavelength of a wave.

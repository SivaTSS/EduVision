In the image, there is a white car with an advertisement on its hood. The car is parked in a parking lot, and there are several people around it. Some of the people are standing close to the car, while others are further away.
In addition to the car and people, there are two cell phones visible in the scene. One cell phone is located near the center of the image, and the other one is closer to the right side of the image. The presence of these cell phones suggests that the people around the car might be using them for communication or other purposes.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a cell membrane. The cell membrane is composed of various components, such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. These components work together to regulate the flow of substances in and out of the cell. The cell membrane also plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell's structural integrity and protecting it from external threats, such as viruses and bacteria.
In addition to the cell membrane, there is a diagram showing the structure and function of ribosomes. Ribosomes are essential for the synthesis of proteins, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the cell. They are composed of two subunits, one large and one small, which come together to form the ribosome. The ribosome reads the genetic code from the messenger RNA (mRNA) and uses it to synthesize proteins according to the instructions encoded in the DNA.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the cell membrane and ribosomes, highlighting their importance in maintaining the cell's structure and function.

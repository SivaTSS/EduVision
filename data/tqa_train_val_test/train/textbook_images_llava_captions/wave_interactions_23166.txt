In the image, there is a three-dimensional representation of an atom, specifically a proton and a neutron. The proton is located on the left side of the atom, while the neutron is situated on the right side. The atom is depicted as a blue circle, and the proton and neutron are shown as green and blue spheres, respectively.
In addition to the proton and neutron, there are two other smaller spheres in the image. One of these smaller spheres is located near the center of the image, while the other is positioned closer to the right side of the image. These smaller spheres are not part of the proton and neutron, but they are part of the larger three-dimensional representation of the atom.

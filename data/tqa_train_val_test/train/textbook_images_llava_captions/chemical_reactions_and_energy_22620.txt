In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram shows the process of energy absorption, while the second diagram illustrates the process of energy dissipation.
In the energy absorption diagram, there is an arrow pointing upwards, indicating the absorption of energy. The second diagram shows the process of energy dissipation, with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating the release of energy.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of how energy is absorbed and dissipated in various processes.

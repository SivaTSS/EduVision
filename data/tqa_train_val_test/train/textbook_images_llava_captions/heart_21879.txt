In the image, there is a detailed illustration of the human heart. The heart is divided into four chambers: the left atrium, the left ventricle, the right atrium, and the right ventricle. The left atrium receives blood from the lungs, while the right atrium receives blood from the body. The left ventricle pumps the blood into the aorta, and the right ventricle pumps the blood into the pulmonary artery.
There are several valves in the heart, including the mitral valve, the tricuspid valve, the pulmonary valve, and the aortic valve. The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle, while the tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The pulmonary valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and the aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta.
In addition to the valves, there are several blood vessels in the heart, including the aorta, the pulmonary

In the image, there is an illustration of a spinal cord and a central nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The spinal cord is depicted as a long, thin red line, extending from the base of the skull to the tailbone. The central nervous system is responsible for coordinating and controlling various functions of the body, such as movement, sensation, and communication between different parts of the body. The spinal cord carries nerve impulses between the brain and the rest of the body, allowing for the transmission of sensory and motor information.

In the image, there are two green spheres, one located on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. The spheres are labeled with the numbers 9 and 10. There is also a red arrow pointing from the left sphere to the right sphere, indicating a connection between the two.
In addition to the spheres, there is a chemical equation displayed in the middle of the image. The equation consists of a series of numbers and letters, including the numbers 9, 10, and 100, as well as the letters "F" and "Fluoride." The equation appears to be related to the two green spheres and the red arrow.

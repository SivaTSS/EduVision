This is a diagram of a molecule. The molecule is made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the carbon atoms, forming a chain-like structure. The carbon atoms are connected to each other, forming a three-dimensional structure. The molecule is shaped like a diamond, with each carbon atom forming a corner of the diamond. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the corners of the diamond, completing the structure. This molecule is an example of a hydrocarbon, which is a type of organic compound made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons are found in many natural resources, such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal. They are also used in the production of many everyday items, such as plastics, fuels, and lubricants.

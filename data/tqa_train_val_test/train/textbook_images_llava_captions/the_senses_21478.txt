In the image, there is a close-up view of the human eye, focusing on the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the nerve that carries visual information from the retina to the brain. The retina is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye, and the iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light entering the eye.
There are several parts of the eye labeled in the image, including the cornea, the lens, and the pupil. The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped surface at the front of the eye, and the lens is the transparent, biconvex structure that focuses light onto the retina. The pupil is the black, circular opening in the center of the iris that controls the amount of light entering the eye.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the human eye and its various components, including the optic nerve, the retina, the iris, the cornea, the lens, and the pupil.

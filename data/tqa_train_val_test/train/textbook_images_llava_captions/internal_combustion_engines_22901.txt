The image depicts a detailed diagram of an internal combustion engine. The engine is comprised of several components, including a cylinder, a piston, a crankshaft, and a fuel-air mixture. The cylinder is filled with fuel-air mixture, and the piston moves up and down within the cylinder. The crankshaft is connected to the piston, and the fuel-air mixture is ignited within the cylinder, causing the piston to move up and down.
There are two blue arrows pointing to the crankshaft, indicating that the crankshaft is turned. Additionally, there are two red arrows pointing to the cylinder, suggesting that the fuel-air mixture is ignited within the cylinder.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the internal combustion engine and its various components.

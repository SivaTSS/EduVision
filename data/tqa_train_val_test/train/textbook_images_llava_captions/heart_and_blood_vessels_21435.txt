In the image, there is a close-up view of a human heart. The heart is divided into two chambers, the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle, while the right atrium is connected to the right ventricle. The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, and the right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary artery.
There are several valves in the heart, including the mitral valve, the tricuspid valve, and the pulmonary valve. The mitral valve connects the left atrium to the left ventricle, the tricuspid valve connects the right atrium to the right ventricle, and the pulmonary valve connects the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. These valves play a crucial role in regulating the flow of blood within the heart and preventing it from flowing backward.

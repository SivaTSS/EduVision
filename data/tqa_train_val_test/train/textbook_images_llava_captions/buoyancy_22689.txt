In the image, there is a diagram showing the concept of fluid pressure. The main focus is on a green square, which represents the pressure of the fluid. The square is located in the center of the diagram, surrounded by various arrows pointing in different directions. These arrows represent the force exerted by the fluid on the walls of the container.
The diagram illustrates the relationship between the size of the force and the pressure exerted by the fluid. The larger the force, the greater the pressure, and vice versa. This concept is crucial in understanding fluid dynamics and the behavior of fluids in various applications, such as hydraulics, pneumatics, and thermodynamics.

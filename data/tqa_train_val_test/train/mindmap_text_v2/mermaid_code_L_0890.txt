  Endothermic Reactions
    Definition
      Description: Chemical reaction needing more energy to break bonds in reactants than released in products
      Energy Input: Constant input of energy, often heat, required
    Temperature
      Product Temperature: Typically lower than reactants
      Reason: More energy needed to break bonds than released
    Examples
      Photosynthesis
        Equation: 6 CO2 + 6 H2 O -> C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2
        Energy Source: Light energy required
      Instant Cold Pack
        Mechanism: Water mixes with chemical, causing endothermic reaction
        Effect: Water gets colder as reaction proceeds
    Comparison
      Exothermic Reactions: More energy released in products than needed to break bonds in reactants

  Newtons Second Law of Motion
    Definition
      Acceleration equals net force divided by mass
    Key Concepts
      Acceleration
        Change in velocity
        Caused by unbalanced force
      Weight
        Force of gravity on mass
        Weight = mass * acceleration due to gravity
    Examples
      Tori's Bookcase
        Force = 20 N
        Mass = 40 kg
        Calculate acceleration
      Ollie's Weight
        Mass = 45 kg
        Calculate weight in newtons
    Relationships
      Force and Acceleration
        Direct relationship
        Doubling force doubles acceleration
      Mass and Acceleration
        Inverse relationship
        Doubling mass halves acceleration
    Problem Solving
      Calculate weight from mass
        F = m * 9.8 m/s2
      Example: Daisy's Weight
        Mass = 35 kg
        Weight = 343 N

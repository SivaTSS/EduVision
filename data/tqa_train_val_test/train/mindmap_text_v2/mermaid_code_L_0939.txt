      Color Determination: Different wavelengths appear as different colors
      Composition: Combination of all wavelengths appears white
    Ultraviolet Light
      Definition: Shorter wavelengths, higher frequencies than visible light
      Uses: Kills bacteria, sterilizes instruments, helps produce vitamin D
      Protection: Wear clothing, apply sunscreen, wear hats
      Risks: Can cause sunburn and skin cancer

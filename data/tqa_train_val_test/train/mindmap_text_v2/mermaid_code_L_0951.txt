    Definition
      Smallest class of elements
      Fall between metals and nonmetals
    Elements
      Boron
      Silicon
      Germanium
      Arsenic
      Antimony
      Tellurium
    Physical Properties
      Shiny like metals
      Brittle like nonmetals
      Conduct heat and electricity
      Exist as solids at room temperature
    Chemical Behavior
      Depends on outer electrons
      Three to six electrons in outer level
      Boron acts like metals
      Arsenic, Antimony, Tellurium act like nonmetals
      Silicon and Germanium can act as either
    Semiconductors
      Conduct electricity at higher temperatures
      Used in computer chips
      Example: Silicon
    Variability
      Boiling and melting points vary

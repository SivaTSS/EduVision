  Glaciers and Their Impact
    Glaciers
      Definition
        Masses of flowing ice
        Cover 10% of Earth's surface
      Types
        Continental Glaciers
          Huge, cover large areas
          Examples: Greenland, Antarctica
        Valley Glaciers
          Long and narrow, form in mountains
    Formation
      Snow accumulation
      Compaction into ice
    Erosion
      Methods
        Plucking
          Rocks picked up and carried
        Abrasion
          Scraping of underlying rock
      Unique Features
        Cirques
          Rounded hollows on mountains
        ArÃªtes
          Jagged ridges between cirques
        Horns
          Sharp peaks formed by multiple cirques
    Deposition
      Glacial Till
        Mixture of particles and rocks
      Landforms
        Moraines
          Ground moraine and end moraine
        Drumlins
          Long, low hills in groups
        Eskers
          Winding ridges from meltwater streams
        Kettle Lakes
          Formed from melting ice chunks
    Historical Context
      Past glacier coverage
        Extent 12,000 years ago
        Areas like Chicago and New York

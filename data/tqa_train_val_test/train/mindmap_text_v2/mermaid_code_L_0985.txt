  Position Time Graphs
    Making a Position-Time Graph
    Slope of a Line Graph
      Represents Velocity
      Steeper Slope Indicates Faster Motion
    Negative Slope
      Can Slope Downward
      Indicates Decreasing Position
    Average Velocity
      Calculated from Change in Position and Time
      Example from Graph 1
        Distance Traveled in 5 Seconds
        50 Meters
    Graph Interpretation
      Graph 1
        Position vs Time
      Graph 2
        Horizontal Line Indicates Zero Velocity
        Steeper Line Indicates Faster Motion

  Seismic Waves
    P-waves
      Properties
        Arrive first
        Travel through solids, liquids, gases
        Fastest (6-7 km/s)
        Compression/expansion motion
        Bend at liquid outer core
        P-wave shadow zone
    S-waves
      Properties
        Arrive second
        Travel only through solids
        Slower (3.5 km/s)
        Up and down motion
        Disappear at outer core

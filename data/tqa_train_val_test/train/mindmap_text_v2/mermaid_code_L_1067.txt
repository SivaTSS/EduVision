  Wave Interactions
    Atoms
      Definition: Building blocks of matter
      Properties: Smallest particles of an element
      Types: Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
    Characteristics
      Size: Extremely small, under 1 nanometer
      Identical Atoms: All atoms of a given element are identical
      Pure Substances: Elements are not mixed with anything else
    Atomic Structure
      Nucleus
        Definition: Center of an atom
        Mass: Contains most of the atom's mass
        Composition: Protons and Neutrons
      Protons
        Charge: Positive
        Role: Determines unique properties of elements
      Neutrons
        Charge: Neutral
        Role: Often equal in number to protons
      Electrons
        Charge: Negative
        Role: Balance charge of protons
        Location: Outside the nucleus
    Models of Atoms
      Purpose: Help scientists understand complex structures
      Example: Simple model representation

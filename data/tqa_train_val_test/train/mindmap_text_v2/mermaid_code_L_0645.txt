  Cellular Respiration
    Glycolysis
      Location: Cytoplasm
      Process: Splitting of glucose
      Products: 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP (net gain), NADH
      Oxygen Requirement: Yes/No (occurs with or without oxygen)
    Krebs Cycle
      Location: Mitochondria
      Structure: Cristae (increases surface area)
      Inputs: Acetyl-CoA from pyruvate
      Products: NADH, FADH2, ATP, CO2
      Importance: Energy carriers for electron transport chain
    Electron Transport Chain
      Location: Mitochondria
      Function: ATP production
      Key Components: Protein complex, mobile transfer molecules
      Gradient: Proton (H+) gradient formation
      Final Electron Acceptor: Oxygen
    Overall Process
      Reactants: Glucose, Oxygen
      Products: ATP, CO2, Water
      Chemical Reaction: C6H12O6 + 6O2 â†’ 6CO2 + 6H2O
      Total ATP Yield: 36-38 ATP (aerobic), 2 ATP (anaerobic)

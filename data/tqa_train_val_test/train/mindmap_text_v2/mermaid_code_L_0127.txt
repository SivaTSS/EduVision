  distance between stars
    parallax
      definition
        apparent shift in position
        observer's position change
      limitations
        effective up to a few hundred light years
        too small for distant stars
      measurement process
        observe star from one position
        note position relative to distant stars
        wait six months for Earth to move
        observe star again
        calculate distance from shift
    brightness
      method for distant stars
        indirect measurement
        compare observed brightness to expected brightness
        similar properties to the Sun

    Dalton's Atomic Theory
      Basic Ideas
        All substances made of atoms
        Atoms are smallest particles of matter
        Atoms of the same element are alike
        Atoms join to form compounds
      Acceptance
        Accepted by scientists
        Still mostly accepted today
        Atoms are not the smallest particles

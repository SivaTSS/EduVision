  Cellular Respiration Reactions
    What is Cellular Respiration
      Definition
      Process of breaking down glucose with oxygen
      Produces carbon dioxide and water
    Chemical Equation
      C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O
    Catabolic Reaction
      Definition of catabolic reactions
      Bonds broken in glucose
      Energy released
    Energy Release
      Chemical energy stored in glucose
      Converted to heat
      Used to form ATP
    Relation to Breathing
      Inhaling brings in oxygen
      Exhaling releases carbon dioxide and water vapor
    Organisms Involved
      Autotrophs
      Heterotrophs

  saturated hydrocarbons
    definition
      single bonds between carbon atoms
      simplest class of hydrocarbons
      saturated with hydrogen
    example
      ethane
        chemical formula C2H6
        structural formula
          dashes represent single covalent bonds
    general name
      alkanes
        name ends in -ane
        smallest alkane methane
          one carbon atom
        next largest ethane
          two carbon atoms
    properties
      boiling and melting points
        determined by number of carbon atoms
        higher temperatures with more carbon atoms
      states at 20 C
        methane gas
        ethane gas
        propane gas
        butane gas
        pentane liquid
        hexane liquid

    structural formulas
      representation of hydrocarbon compounds
      shapes of molecules
        straight-chain
          carbon atoms lined up
        branched-chain
          carbon atoms branch off
        cyclic
          carbon atoms form a ring
          higher boiling and melting points

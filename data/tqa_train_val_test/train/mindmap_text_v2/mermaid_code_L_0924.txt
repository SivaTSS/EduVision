  Inertia
    What is inertia
      Definition: Tendency to resist change in motion
      Newton's first law: Object at rest stays at rest, object in motion stays in motion
    How inertia affects motion
      Resting objects remain at rest
      Moving objects keep moving unless acted on by unbalanced force
      Example: Body moves forward in a car when it stops
    Relationship between inertia and mass
      Greater mass = greater inertia
      Example: Easier to push one cousin on skateboard than two
    Real-life example: Skateboarding

      Gravity's downward force
      Why skateboard doesn't tip over

    Overcoming inertia
      Unbalanced force needed to change motion
      Example: Lauren pushes skateboard to start motion
      Inertia keeps object moving once in motion
      Friction eventually stops motion
      Example: Skateboard rolling on smooth surface

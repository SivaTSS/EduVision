  Stress in Earth's Crust
    Types of Stress
      Confining Stress
        Definition: Weight of overlying rock compresses deeply buried rock
        Deformation: No movement, rock does not deform
      Compression Stress
        Definition: Squeezes rocks together
        Deformation: Folds or fractures rocks
        Common at: Convergent boundaries
      Tension Stress
        Definition: Pulls rocks apart
        Deformation: Lengthens or breaks rocks
        Common at: Divergent boundaries
      Shear Stress
        Definition: Forces slide past each other
        Deformation: Common at transform boundaries
    Rock Deformation
      Plastic Deformation
        Definition: Rock bends without breaking
      Elastic Deformation
        Definition: Rock returns to original shape when stress stops
      Fractures and Faults
        Definition: Fracture is a joint if no movement, fault if movement occurs
        Types of Faults
          Dip-Slip Faults
            Definition: Fault plane at an angle
          Strike-Slip Faults
            Definition: Fault plane is vertical
            Types: Right-lateral and left-lateral
    Earthquakes
      Causes
        Result of plate tectonic motions
        Types of stress at plate boundaries
      Effects
        Damage caused by sudden movement of rocks
    Mountain Formation
      Types of Mountains
        Formed at plate boundaries
        Volcanic mountains at hotspots
      Processes
        Convergent boundaries: Crumpling and folding
        Divergent boundaries: Basin-and-range formation
    Folds
      Types of Folds
        Monoclines
          Definition: Simple one-step bend
        Anticlines
          Definition: Upward arching fold
        Synclines
          Definition: Downward bending fold
    Geological Features
      Rock Layers
        Oldest rocks at the bottom, youngest at the top
      Fault Zones
        Clusters of faults creating zones of weakness

  Kinetic Energy
    Definition
      Energy of moving matter
      Anything moving has kinetic energy
    Factors Affecting Kinetic Energy
      Mass
      Velocity
    Calculation
      KE = 1/2 mass velocity^2
      Increase in velocity increases KE more than mass
    Examples
      Bowling ball at 4 m/s, 7 kg
      Juan running at 1 m/s, 40 kg
      Juan's dad at 1 m/s, 80 kg
    Units
      Joules (J)
      1 Joule = 1 Newton meter

  Newtons Third Law of Motion
    Definition
      Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
      Forces act in pairs
    Action and Reaction
      Example: Jerod on skateboard
        Action: Jerod pushes ground
        Reaction: Jerod moves forward
      Example: Astronauts in video
        Action: Wearing battery pack affects motion
    Forces Representation
      Arrows indicate direction and strength
      Action forces vs Reaction forces
        Equal in strength
        Opposite in direction
    Balanced vs Unbalanced Forces
      Action-reaction forces are not balanced
      Balanced forces act on the same object
      Action-reaction forces act on different objects
    Real-life Examples
      Leaning on a wall
      Skateboarders pushing against each other

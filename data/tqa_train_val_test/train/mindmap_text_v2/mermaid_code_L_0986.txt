  Potential Energy
    Definition
      Stored energy in a person or object
    Types
      Gravitational Potential Energy
        Depends on weight and height
        Example: Diver on diving board
        Calculation: GPE = weight x height
      Elastic Potential Energy
        Due to shape of an object
        Results from stretching or compressing
        Example: Pogo stick and slingshot
    Examples
      Diver's Gravitational Potential Energy
        Weight: 500 N
        Height: 5 m
        GPE = 500 N x 5 m
      Girl on Sled
        Weight: 140 N
        Height: 4 m
        GPE = 140 N x 4 m = 560 N m
      Gymnast on Balance Beam
        Weight: 360 N
        Height: 1.2 m
        GPE = 360 N x 1.2 m = 432 N m
    Other Forms
      Chemical Energy
        Stored in bonds of compounds
        Example: Food and batteries
      Nuclear Energy
        Stored in atomic nuclei
        Example: Uranium
    Mechanical Energy
      Involves movement or potential to move

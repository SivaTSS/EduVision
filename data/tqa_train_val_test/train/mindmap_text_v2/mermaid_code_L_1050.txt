  Thermal Radiation
    Definition
      Transfer of thermal energy by waves
      Can travel through air or empty space
    Examples
      Campfire warming hands
      Sun warming Earth
    Characteristics
      Everything radiates thermal energy
      Thermal energy is total kinetic energy of particles
    Methods of Transfer
      Thermal radiation
      Conduction
      Convection
    Insulation
      Poorly insulated homes radiate more energy
      Special cameras detect radiated heat

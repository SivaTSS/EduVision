  Activation Energy
    Definition
      Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction
    Importance
      Reactants need energy to overcome repulsion and break bonds
      Example: Starting a car engine requires a spark
    Types of Reactions
      Endothermic
        Requires constant input of energy
        Needs activation energy to start
      Exothermic
        Releases energy when occurring
        Also requires activation energy to start
    Energy Changes
      Both endothermic and exothermic reactions need activation energy
      Exothermic reactions produce more energy than they use after starting

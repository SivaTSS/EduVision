  Momentum Conservation
    Law of Conservation of Momentum
      Definition
        Total momentum is conserved
        Momentum transferred between objects
    Vehicle Collision
      Missing Velocity
        Fill in the missing velocity in diagram
    Skater Collision
      Skater 1 and Skater 2
        Skater 2 has more momentum before collision
        Momentum transferred during collision
        Skater 1 gains momentum, Skater 2 loses momentum
      Head-on Collision
        Momentum is conserved

  Velocity
    Definition
      Measure of speed and direction
      Vector quantity
    Difference from Speed
      Speed only measures how fast
      Velocity includes direction
    Representation
      Arrows represent velocity
        Length indicates speed
        Direction indicates motion
    Examples
      Car traveling north at 50 mi/h
      Car traveling east at 25 mi/h
      Average velocity of a car traveling northwest for 90 miles in 2 hours
    Calculation
      Average velocity formula
        velocity = distance time
      SI unit for velocity
        m/s plus direction
    Case Study
      Jerod's bike ride
        Constant speed but changing direction
      Dog racing example
        Velocity calculation with direction

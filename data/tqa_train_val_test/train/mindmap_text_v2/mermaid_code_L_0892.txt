    Law of Gravity
      Definition
        Attraction between objects
        Does not require contact
      Effects
        Pulls objects toward Earth's center
        Keeps moons and satellites in orbit
        Holds planets around the Sun
      Characteristics
        Invisible force
        Acts over large distances
        Weaker with distance
      Everyday Examples
        Earthâ€™s gravity keeps us grounded
        Pulls on objects in the sky and space
        Affects meteors and skydivers
        Keeps the Moon in orbit
        Holds artificial satellites

        Statement: "What goes up must come down"
        Spacecraft can overcome gravity
        Everyday actions (climbing stairs, jumping)
        Requires force larger than gravity

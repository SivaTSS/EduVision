  Nitrogen Cycle
    Largest Source of Nitrogen
      Nitrogen gas (N2) in the atmosphere
    Nitrogen Fixation
      Conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonium (NH4+)
      Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
        Live in roots of plants (e.g., pea family)
    Assimilation
      Plants absorb nitrogen in the form of nitrates
      Passed to animals through food web
    Decomposition
      Decomposers transform nitrogen in dead organisms to ammonium
    Nitrification
      Ammonium converted to nitrates by nitrifying bacteria
    Denitrification
      Nitrates converted back to gaseous nitrogen by denitrifying bacteria
    Human Impact
      Burning fossil fuels releases nitrogen oxides
      Leads to acid rain
    Importance of Nitrogen
      Essential for proteins and nucleic acids (DNA)

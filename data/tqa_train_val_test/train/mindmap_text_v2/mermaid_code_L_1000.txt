  Radioisotopes
    Definition
      What is a radioisotope
      Example: carbon-14
    Stability
      Unstable nuclei
      Proton-to-neutron ratio
        Stable nucleus ratio
        Unstable nucleus ratio
    Isotopes
      Definition of isotopes
      Radioactive isotopes
    Elements
      Elements with only radioactive isotopes
      Elements with more than 83 protons
        All isotopes are radioactive
        Unstable nuclei due to proton repulsion
    Carbon
      Carbon-12
        Stable nucleus
        Proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1
      Carbon-14
        Unstable nucleus
        Proton-to-neutron ratio 1:1.3
        Use in dating fossils
    Stability Methods
      Ways to become stable
        Decay
        Proton-to-neutron ratio adjustment
        Other methods

  Friction
    Definition
      Opposes motion between surfaces
      Caused by roughness of surfaces
    Types of Friction
      Static Friction
        Acts on resting objects
        Example: Walking on a sidewalk
      Sliding Friction
        Acts on sliding objects
        Weaker than static friction
        Example: Sliding furniture
      Rolling Friction
        Acts on rolling objects
        Much weaker than sliding friction
        Example: Moving boxes on a dolly
      Fluid Friction
        Acts on objects moving through fluids
        Includes air resistance
        Example: Skydiver with parachute
    Factors Affecting Friction
      Surface roughness
      Weight of objects
    Effects of Friction
      Produces heat
        Useful for warming hands
        Can cause overheating in engines
      Can be beneficial or detrimental
        Example: Sand on icy sidewalks
        Example: Excessive friction in engines

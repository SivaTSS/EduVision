  kidneys
    pituitary gland
      location: below brain
      function: releases hormones
      controls urine production
    nephron
      definition: tiny tube-shaped structures
      function: filtering waste from blood
      components
        coiled tubules
        cortex
        medulla
    kidney functions
      maintain homeostasis
      regulate body fluid volume
      balance salt ions
      excrete nitrogen-containing wastes
    urine formation process
      blood flow: renal artery to capillaries
      filtration: water, salts, sugars, urea
      urine collection: ureters to bladder
    antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
      source: pituitary gland
      function: controls water reabsorption
      effect of hydration levels
        low hydration: more ADH, darker urine
        high hydration: less ADH, lighter urine
    urinary system
      components
        ureters
        bladder
        urethra
      urination process
        nerve signals from bladder
        release of urine

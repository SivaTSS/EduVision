  Halogens
    What are halogens
      Definition
      Group 17 elements
      Examples: Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, Astatine
    Why are halogens very reactive
      Seven valence electrons
      Eager to gain one electron
      Reactivity decreases down the group
      Reactions with alkali metals
    Physical properties of halogens
      States of matter at room temperature
        Gases: Fluorine, Chlorine
        Liquid: Bromine
        Solids: Iodine, Astatine
      Color variations
        Fluorine and Chlorine: Green
        Bromine: Red
        Iodine and Astatine: Nearly black
      Electrical and thermal conductivity
      Melting and boiling points
    Uses of halogens
      Dental hygiene
        Fluorine in toothpaste and mouthwash
        Chlorine in toothpaste and mouthwash
      Preventing tooth decay
      Killing germs
      Bleaching clothes

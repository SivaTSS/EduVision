    Biomass
      Definition
        Material from recently living plants and animals
      Uses
        Direct burning for heating and cooking
        Processing into biofuels
    Biofuels
      Advantages
        Cleaner burning than fossil fuels
        Less pollution and carbon dioxide
        Liquid form suitable for gas tanks
      Sources
        Crops (corn, algae)
        Organic materials (almond shells, food scraps, cow manure)
      Production
        Biochemical refining
        Thermochemical refining
        Gasification with oxygen
    Algae
      Advantages over other sources
        Requires less land and energy
        Can grow in non-arable areas
        Carbon neutral
      Research focus
        Promising alternative to traditional crops
        Potential for large-scale production
    Challenges
      Inefficiency of some crops
        Corn as an inefficient source
      Environmental impact
        Fertilizers and pesticides as pollutants
      Energy balance
        Energy consumed vs. energy produced

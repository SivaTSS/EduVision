  Valence Electrons
    Definition
      Electrons in outer energy level
      Participate in interactions
    Importance
      Determine reactivity
      Influence conductivity
    Electron Dot Diagrams
      Representation of valence electrons
      Chemical symbol surrounded by dots
    Octet Rule
      Atoms seek to have eight valence electrons
      Stability achieved with full outer energy level
    Reactivity
      Metals give up electrons
      Nonmetals gain electrons
      Metalloids conduct electricity but less than metals
    Periodic Table
      Valence electrons increase across periods
      Same group elements have similar valence electrons
      Group 1 has one valence electron
      Group 18 has eight valence electrons
    Examples
      Sodium (Na) gives up an electron
      Chlorine (Cl) accepts an electron
      Calcium (Ca) reacts with oxygen (O)
    Conductivity
      Metals like copper conduct electricity
      Nonmetals like carbon do not conduct electricity
      Semiconductors like silicon and germanium

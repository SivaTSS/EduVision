  Surface Wave
    Definition
      Description: Wave traveling along the surface of a medium
      Examples: Ocean waves
    Particle Movement
      Motion: Up and down, back and forth
      Overall Motion: Circular
    Behavior in Shallow Water
      Dragging: Waves slow down due to friction
      Steepening: Causes waves to break
      Result: Water carried onto shore as surf
    Causes of Ocean Waves
      Main Cause: Wind blowing across water
      Energy Transfer: Air molecules to water molecules
      Wave Size: Larger waves with stronger winds
    Wave Types
      Transverse Wave: Particles move up and down perpendicular to wave direction
      Longitudinal Wave: Particles move parallel to wave direction
      Surface Wave: Combination of transverse and longitudinal

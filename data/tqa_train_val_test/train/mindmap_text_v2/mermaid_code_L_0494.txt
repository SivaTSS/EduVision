  Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
    Photosynthesis
      Requirements
        Sunlight
        Carbon Dioxide
        Water
      Process
        Conversion of sunlight
        Production of glucose
        Release of oxygen
    Cellular Respiration
      Requirements
        Glucose
        Oxygen
      Process
        Breakdown of glucose
        Production of ATP
        Release of carbon dioxide
    Relationship
      Opposite Equations
        Cellular Respiration: C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2 O
        Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2 O -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2
      Interdependence
        Products of photosynthesis are reactants for respiration
        Exchange of gases stabilizes atmospheric levels
    Importance
      Energy Transfer
        Sunlight to glucose
        Glucose to ATP
      Carbon Cycle
        Cellular respiration releases CO2
        Photosynthesis absorbs CO2

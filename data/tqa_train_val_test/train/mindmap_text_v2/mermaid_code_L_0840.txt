  Compound Machine
    Definition
      Consists of more than one simple machine
      Examples
        Wheelbarrow
        Corkscrew
        Bicycles
        Cars
    Wheelbarrow
      Simple Machines
        Lever
        Wheel and Axle
      Function
        Easier to carry heavy objects
        Lever applies upward force
        Wheel increases force for pushing
    Corkscrew
      Simple Machines
        Screw
        Two Levers
      Function
        Pierces cork and pulls it out
        Levers increase force and change direction
    Efficiency
      Lower than simple machines
      More moving parts lead to more friction
      Friction reduces efficiency
      Lubricants reduce friction
    Mechanical Advantage
      Greater than simple machines
      Equals product of mechanical advantages of components
      Example: Wheelbarrow has mechanical advantage of 4

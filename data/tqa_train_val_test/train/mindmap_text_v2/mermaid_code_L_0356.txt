      Map analysis
      Similar fossils and rocks on opposite sides of oceans
    Inferences
      Continents moved through oceanic crust
      Suggested icebreaker analogy
    Division of Pangaea
      Began to divide into separate continents
    Rejection of Wegener's Idea
      Lack of plausible mechanism
      Centrifugal and tidal forces deemed insufficient
    Harry Hess's Contribution

      Proposed hypothesis of tectonic plates
    Tectonic Plates
      Composed of Earth's crust and upper mantle
    Acceptance of Ideas
      Need for evidence and mechanisms
      Some hypotheses not widely accepted despite evidence
    Thermal Convection
      Arthur Holmes' elaboration on Wegener's ideas
      Convection cells as potential driving force

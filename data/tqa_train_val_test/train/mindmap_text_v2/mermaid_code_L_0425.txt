  Cellular Respiration
    Definition
      Process of breaking down glucose
      Produces ATP
      Takes place in cytoplasm and mitochondria
    Stages
      Glycolysis
        Occurs in cytoplasm
        Anaerobic process
        Produces 2 ATP
        Splits glucose into pyruvate
      Krebs Cycle
        Occurs in mitochondria
        Aerobic process
        Produces 2 ATP
        Combines oxygen with carbon from pyruvate
      Electron Transport
        Occurs in mitochondria
        Aerobic process
        Produces up to 34 ATP
        Combines oxygen with hydrogen
    Relationship with Photosynthesis
      Interdependent processes
      Store and release energy
    Fermentation
      Types
        Lactic Acid Fermentation
          Produces lactic acid
          Occurs in muscle cells and some bacteria
        Alcoholic Fermentation
          Produces alcohol and carbon dioxide
          Occurs in yeast
    Advantages
      Aerobic Respiration
        More energy produced
        More ATP molecules formed
      Anaerobic Respiration
        Faster process
        Allows survival in low oxygen environments

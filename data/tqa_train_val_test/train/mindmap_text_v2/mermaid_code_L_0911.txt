    Properties of Metalloids
      Conductivity
        Conduct electricity, but less than metals
      Appearance
        Shiny like metals, brittle like nonmetals
      Chemical Behavior
        Depends on valence electrons
    Applications
      Silicon
        Used in computer chips
      Germanium
        Used in fiber optics
      Arsenic
        Toxic, used in rat poison
      Tellurium
        Used in solar panels

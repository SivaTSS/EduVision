  Groundwater
    Definition
      Groundwater is freshwater below Earth's surface
    Aquifer
      Definition
        Underground layer of rock saturated with groundwater
      Example
        Ogallala aquifer in the American Midwest
      Recharge
        Water infiltrates from the surface
      Water Table
        Top of the saturated rock layer
        Rises and falls based on rainfall
    Springs
      Definition
        Water flows out where aquifer meets surface
      Characteristics
        May contain dissolved minerals
        Can be heated by magma
    Geysers
      Definition
        Heated groundwater erupts under pressure
      Example
        Old Faithful geyser
    Wells
      Purpose
        To access groundwater from aquifers
      Function
        Hole dug or drilled to reach aquifer
    Water Usage
      Importance of freshwater
      Need for wise water use
      Consequences of over-extraction
        Lowering water table
        Potential aquifer depletion
        Ground subsidence

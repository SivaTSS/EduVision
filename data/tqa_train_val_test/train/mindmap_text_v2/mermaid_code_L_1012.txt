  Scientific Graphing
    Advantages of Graphs
      Visual representation of data
      Easier interpretation than tables
    Types of Graphs
      Bar Graphs
        Compare values for different categories
        Example: Average tornadoes in cities
      Circle Graphs
        Show percents of a whole
        Example: Tornado strength distribution
      Line Graphs
        Show changes over time
        Example: Monthly tornado averages
    Data Examples
      Table 1.1
        Average tornadoes per year
        Cities ranked by tornado frequency
      Table 1.2
        Percent of U.S. tornadoes by strength
        F-scale ratings from F0 to F5
      Table 1.3
        Average number of tornadoes per month
        Trends over the year

  Nitrogen Cycle in Ecosystems
    Nitrogen Importance
      Essential for organic molecules
      Components: amino acids, chlorophyll, nucleic acids
    Nitrogen Fixation
      Process of converting nitrogen to usable form
      Organisms involved
        Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
        Blue-green algae
        Lightning
      Locations
        Soil
        Symbiotic relationships with legumes
    Role of Bacteria
      Soil bacteria
        Convert organic nitrogen to ammonia
        Nitrifying bacteria
          Oxidize ammonia to nitrites
          Oxidize nitrites to nitrates
        Denitrifying bacteria
          Reduce nitrates to molecular nitrogen
    Plant and Animal Interaction
      Plants absorb nitrates
      Animals consume plants
      Decomposition returns nitrogen to soil
    Importance of Legumes
      Act as nitrogen fixers
      Provide ammonia to soil

    First Line of Defense
      Physical Barriers
        Skin
          Largest organ
          Physical barrier
          Multiple layers
        Mucous Membranes
          Lined in mouth, nose, lungs, stomach
          Release mucus
          Contain cilia
      Chemical Barriers
        Body Fluids
          Mucus
            Contains lysozymes
            Traps pathogens
          Sweat
            Contains lysozymes
          Tears
            Contains lysozymes
          Saliva
            Contains lysozymes
          Stomach Acid
            Hydrochloric acid
            Kills pathogens
          Urine
            Acidic environment

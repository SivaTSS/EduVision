  Balancing Chemical Equations
    Balanced Chemical Equations
      Examples
        Zn + HCl  ZnCl2 + H2
        2 Zn + 2 HCl  ZnCl2 + H2
        2 Zn + HCl  ZnCl2 + H2
        Zn + 2 HCl  ZnCl2 + H2
    Importance of Balancing
      Conservation of Mass
      Same Number of Atoms
    Coefficients
      Definition
        Number in front of chemical symbol
        Indicates number of atoms/molecules
      Examples
        2 H2
        2 H2 O
    Steps to Balance
      Count Atoms
        Reactants vs Products
      Place Coefficients
        Use smallest coefficients
        Never change subscripts
      Repeat Until Balanced
    Common Mistakes
      Incorrect Balancing
        Example: H2 O  H2 + O2
        Correct: 2 H2 O  H2 + O2

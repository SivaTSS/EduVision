  Machines
    Definition
      Device that makes work easier by changing a force
    Types of Machines
      Simple Machines
        Levers
        Hammers
        Paddles
      Complex Machines
        Appliances
        Power Tools
    Functions
      Increase Force
      Increase Distance
      Change Direction
    Efficiency
      Definition
        Measure of how well a machine reduces friction
      Calculation
        Efficiency = Output work / Input work * 100%
    Mechanical Advantage
      Definition
        Number of times a machine multiplies input force
      Calculation
        Actual Mechanical Advantage = Output force / Input force
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage = Input distance / Output distance
    Examples
      Doorknobs
      Nutcrackers
      Ramps
      Pulleys
    Key Concepts
      Input Force
      Output Force
      Input Distance
      Output Distance

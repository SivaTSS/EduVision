  Homeostasis
    Definition
      Ability to maintain stable internal environment
      Response to changing external environment
    Key Variables
      Temperature
        Normal range: 98.6Â°F
        Affects enzyme function
      Fluid balance
        Regulated through urine concentration
      Blood glucose levels
        Insulin and glucagon roles
    Feedback Mechanisms
      Negative Feedback
        Response keeps variable close to set value
        Examples
          Body temperature regulation
          Blood glucose regulation
      Positive Feedback
        Response increases likelihood of event
        Examples
          Milk production
          Childbirth contractions
    Internal Conditions in Humans
      Temperature regulation
      Blood flow changes
        Increases with temperature rise
        Decreases with temperature drop
      Hormones
        ADH function
        Insulin and glucagon roles
    Ectotherms vs Endotherms
      Ectotherms
        Body temperature related to environment
      Endotherms
        Maintain stable internal temperature

      Mechanism of response

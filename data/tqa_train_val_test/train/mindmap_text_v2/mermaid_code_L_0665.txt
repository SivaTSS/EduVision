  RNA
    mRNA
      role: carries instructions from nucleus to cytoplasm
      location: produced in the nucleus
    tRNA
      role: brings amino acids to ribosome
      specificity: each tRNA is specific for an amino acid
    rRNA
      role: part of the ribosome
      function: site of protein synthesis
    comparison
      DNA vs RNA
        sugar: ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA
        base: uracil in RNA replaces thymine in DNA
        structure: RNA is single-stranded, DNA is double-stranded
    ribosome
      structure: composed of rRNA and proteins
      function: synthesizes proteins

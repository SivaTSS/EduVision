  Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
    Definition
      Unsaturated hydrocarbons have at least one double or triple bond
    Types
      Alkenes
        Contain one or more double bonds
        Name ends in -ene
        Can form straight chains, branched chains, or rings
        Isomers exist with the same atoms but different shapes
        Smaller alkenes are gases at room temperature
        Larger alkenes are liquids or waxy solids
      Aromatic Hydrocarbons
        Cyclic hydrocarbons with alternating single and double bonds
        Smallest is benzene with one ring
        Larger consist of two or more rings
        Known for strong aroma
      Alkynes
        Contain one or more triple bonds
        Name ends in -yne
        Rarely occur in ring shapes
        Smallest is ethyne (C2H2), also called acetylene
    Chemical Formulas
      Examples
        CH4
        C2H6
        C3H8
        C2H2
    Properties
      Carbon atoms form four covalent bonds
      Unsaturated hydrocarbons cannot bond with as many hydrogen atoms

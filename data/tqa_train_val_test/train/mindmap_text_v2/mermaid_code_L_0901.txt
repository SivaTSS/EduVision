    Motion
      Forces control motion of everyday objects
      Changes in motion due to applied forces

      Newton (N)
        1 N = 1 kg m/sÂ²
        Named after Sir Isaac Newton
    Representation
      Force as a vector
        Size and direction
        Represented by arrows
        Length indicates strength
        Direction indicates movement

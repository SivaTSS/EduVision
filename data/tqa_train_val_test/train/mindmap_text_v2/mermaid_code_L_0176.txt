  Galaxies
    Definition
      Composed of millions to billions of stars
      Types
        Spiral
        Elliptical
        Irregular
    Characteristics
      Size range from millions to billions of stars
      Locations of star formation
    Spiral Galaxies
      Appearance
        Rotating disk of stars and dust
        Bulge in the middle
        Spiral arms
      Examples
        Andromeda Galaxy
        Sombrero Galaxy
        Pinwheel Galaxy
    Elliptical Galaxies
      Appearance
        Egg-shaped
        Color ranges from reddish to yellowish
      Size
        Smallest as small as globular clusters
        Giants can contain over a trillion stars
      Gas and Dust
        Contains very little gas and dust
        Some may contain dust due to galaxy collisions
    Irregular Galaxies
      Definition
        Not clearly spiral or elliptical
      Formation
        Deformed by gravitational attraction or collisions
      Example
        NGC 1427A
    Dwarf Galaxies
      Definition
        Small galaxies with a few million to a few billion stars
      Commonality
        Most common type in the universe
      Shapes
        Mostly irregular
        Also dwarf elliptical and dwarf spiral galaxies
      Interaction
        Often found near larger galaxies
        Can collide and merge with larger neighbors

  recombinant dna
    definition
      combination of DNA from two different sources
      useful in gene cloning
      identifies gene function
      produces useful proteins
        insulin production
    gene cloning
      exact copy of a gene
      steps
        vector creation
          gene or DNA piece in vector
        host cell insertion
          vector placed in bacterium
        gene copying
          cloned inside bacterium
          bacterial and vector DNA copied
        protein production
          millions of copies in 12-24 hours
    plasmids
      small rings of DNA in bacteria
      not part of bacterial chromosome
      used as vectors
      manipulation and insertion
        invaluable tool in research
    antibiotic resistance
      segments in plasmid
        antibiotic resistance segments
        origin of replication
    historical context

          SC meaning
          gene carried
        DNA ligase function
        bacteria uptake of recombinant plasmid
        isolation of bacteria with both genes

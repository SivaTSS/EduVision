  Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
    Definition
      Scatter graph of star classes
      Properties
        Luminosity
        Absolute magnitude
        Color
        Effective temperature
    History
      Created by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell
      Around 1910
    Axes
      Horizontal
        Temperature
          High to low
      Vertical
        Luminosity
          Logarithmic scale
    Main Sequence
      Most stars located here
      Hydrogen fusion into helium
      Sun's position
    Star Types
      White Dwarfs
        Less bright than expected
        Very small size
        Final evolutionary state for low mass stars
      Red Giants
        Brighter than expected
        Much larger size
        Expands to several thousand times the size of main sequence stars
    Temperature and Color
      Hotter stars are bluish
      Cooler stars are reddish
    Evolutionary Process
      Main-sequence star evolves to red giant
      Red giant may become white dwarf
      White dwarf cools to black dwarf

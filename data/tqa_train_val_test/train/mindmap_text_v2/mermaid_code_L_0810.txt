  Metabolism and Biochemical Reactions
    Biochemical Reactions
      Definition
        Chemical reactions in living organisms
        Sum of reactions is metabolism
    Categories of Reactions
      Catabolic Reactions
        Break bonds
        Release energy
        Example: complex carbohydrates to simple sugars
      Anabolic Reactions
        Form bonds
        Absorb energy
        Example: simple sugars to complex carbohydrates
    Role of Enzymes
      Definition
        Proteins that increase reaction rates
      Function
        Reduce activation energy
        Not changed in reactions
        Highly specific and efficient
    Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
      Photosynthesis
        Converts light energy to chemical energy
        Reactants: CO2 and H2O
        Products: O2 and glucose
      Cellular Respiration
        Releases energy from glucose
        Reactants: O2 and glucose
        Products: CO2, H2O, and energy

  Friction Types
    Static Friction
      Definition: Acts on resting objects
      Example: Hiking on a trail
      Importance: Prevents slipping
    Sliding Friction
      Definition: Acts on sliding objects
      Comparison: Weaker than static friction
      Example: Writing with a pencil
      Importance: Helps in braking a bike
    Rolling Friction
      Definition: Acts on rolling objects
      Comparison: Weaker than sliding and static friction
      Importance: Used in transportation (wheels)
      Example: Ball bearings in machines
    Fluid Friction
      Definition: Acts on objects moving through fluids
      Examples: Water resistance, air resistance
      Importance: Affects speed and motion of objects

  Chemistry of Compounds
    Definition
      Unique substance formed by chemical combination of elements
      Consists of same elements in same ratio
    Types of Compounds
      Covalent Compounds
        Formed by sharing valence electrons
        Exist as individual molecules
        Example: Water (H2O)
      Ionic Compounds
        Formed by transferring electrons
        Exist as a matrix of ions (crystal)
        Example: Sodium chloride (table salt)
    Properties
      Fixed ratio of elements
      Different compounds have different properties
    Comparison with Mixtures
      Mixtures can have varying proportions
      Example: Lemonade (water, lemon juice, sugar)
    Chemical Bonds
      Force of attraction between atoms or ions
      Types: Covalent bonds and Ionic bonds
    Examples
      Water (H2O)
        2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom
      Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)
        Different ratio than water
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
        Odorless, colorless gas
      Carbon Monoxide (CO)
        Harmful gas, colorless and odorless

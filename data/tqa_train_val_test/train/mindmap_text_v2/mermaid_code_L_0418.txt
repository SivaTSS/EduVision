  Water Pollution
    Definition
      Water pollution occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources
      Threatens supply of clean, fresh water
    Causes
      Fertilizer runoff
        Leads to algal blooms
        Causes dead zones
      Point-source pollution
        Examples: wastewater from factories, sewage treatment plants
      Thermal pollution
        Caused by heated water discharge
    Effects
      Algal blooms
        Excessive growth of algae
        Outcompetes other organisms
      Dead zones
        Areas with hypoxic water
        Cannot support life
      Ocean pollution
        Trash, mainly plastics
        Ocean acidification
          Increased carbon dioxide levels
          Harms aquatic organisms
    Solutions
      Reducing fertilizer use
      Preserving wetlands
        Slow down and filter runoff
        Provide breeding grounds

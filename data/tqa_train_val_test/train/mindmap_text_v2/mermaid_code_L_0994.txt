  Protein Classification
    What are proteins?
      Biochemical compounds
      Contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur
      Made of amino acids
    Building blocks of proteins
      Amino acids
        20 different types
        Linked by covalent bonds
    Protein shape
      Determined by amino acid sequence
      Weaker bonds hold chains together
    Protein function
      Tissue components (muscle)
      Enzymes (speed up reactions)
      Hormones (regulate processes)
      Antibodies (defend against infections)
      Transport proteins (e.g., hemoglobin)

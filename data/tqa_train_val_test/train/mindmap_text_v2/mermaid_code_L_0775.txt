    History
      1700s
        Early attempts to organize elements
      1860s
        Dmitri Mendeleev
          Developed first periodic table
          Organized by atomic mass
          Predicted unknown elements
    Mendeleev's Periodic Table
      Structure
        Rows
          Eight elements per row
        Columns
          Groups with similar properties
      Characteristics
        Periodic nature
        Useful for predicting elements
    Modern Periodic Table
      Structure
        Organized by atomic number
        Rows called periods
        Columns called groups
      Features
        Chemical symbols
        Classes of elements
          Metals
          Metalloids
          Nonmetals
      Differences from Mendeleev's Table
        Based on atomic number
        More elements (over 110)
    Classification of Elements
      Types

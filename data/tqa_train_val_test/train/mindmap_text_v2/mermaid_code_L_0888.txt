  Electrons
    Discovery
      Discovered by: J.J. Thomson
      Year: 1897
      Significance: Fundamental to atomic theory
      Initial location: Outside nucleus
      Modern view: Orbitals and energy levels
    Characteristics
      Type: Fundamental particles (leptons)
      Charge: -1
      Mass: 1/2000 of proton/neutron
      Neutral atoms: Equal number of electrons and protons
    Atomic Structure
      Location: Outside nucleus
      Movement: Constantly moving due to attraction to nucleus
      Orbitals: Regions of probable electron location
        Types: S orbitals (spherical), P orbitals (dumbbell)
    Energy Levels
      Definition: Fixed distances from nucleus
      Distribution: Electrons fill lower levels first
      Valence Electrons: Outermost electrons involved in reactions
      Example: Beryllium atom (4 protons, 4 electrons)
        Valence electrons: 2

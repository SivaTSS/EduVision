  Scientific Modeling
    What is a model
      Definition
      Examples
        Road map
        Water molecule
        Electric circuit
    Why are models useful in science
      Investigate difficult subjects
        Extremely small (atoms)
        Distant objects (stars)
        Complex systems (electric grid)
    Characteristics of a good model
      Closely represents reality
      Simpler and easier to understand
    Simple models in physical science
      Two-dimensional diagrams
      Three-dimensional structures
      Mathematical formulas
      Computer simulations

  Blood Vessels
    Types of Blood Vessels
      Arteries
        Carry blood away from the heart
        Largest artery: Aorta
        Branch into smaller arteries and capillaries
      Veins
        Return blood to the heart
        Superior vena cava
        Inferior vena cava
        Only veins that carry oxygen-rich blood: Pulmonary veins
      Capillaries
        Smallest blood vessels
        Connect arteries and veins
        Exchange gases and substances
    Structure and Function
      Arteries vs Veins
        Arteries have thicker walls
        Veins have valves
      Endothelium
        Tissue lining blood vessels
        Present in arteries and veins
    Circulation
      Pulmonary Circulation
        Carries oxygen-poor blood to lungs
        Returns oxygen-rich blood to heart
      Systemic Circulation
        Carries oxygen-rich blood to body
        Returns oxygen-poor blood to heart
    Heart Function
      Two separate pumps
        Right side: pumps deoxygenated blood
        Left side: pumps oxygenated blood

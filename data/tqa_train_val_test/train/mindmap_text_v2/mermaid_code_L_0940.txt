  Lipid Classification
    Lipids
      Definition: Biochemical compounds for energy storage
      Types
        Fats
          Characteristics: Solid, used by animals
          Examples: Butter, fats in meats
        Oils
          Characteristics: Liquid, used by plants
          Examples: Olive oil, vegetable oil
    Fatty Acids
      Types
        Saturated
          Structure: Only single bonds between carbon atoms
          Characteristics: Saturated with hydrogen, found in fats
          Example: 12 hydrogen atoms in saturated fatty acid
        Unsaturated
          Structure: At least one double bond between carbon atoms
          Characteristics: Unsaturated with hydrogen, found in oils
          Example: 10 hydrogen atoms in unsaturated fatty acid
    Phospholipids
      Definition: Lipids containing phosphorus
      Structure
        Hydrophilic end: Attracts water, polar
        Hydrophobic end: Repels water, nonpolar
      Function: Make up cell membranes
        Arrangement: Hydrophilic ends outside, hydrophobic ends inside

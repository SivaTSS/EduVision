  Mechanical Advantage
    Definition
      Ratio of output force to input force
      Change in input force by a machine
    Types
      Actual Mechanical Advantage
        Reflects force increase/decrease
        Takes friction into account
        Calculated as Output force / Input force
      Ideal Mechanical Advantage
        Reflects force change without friction
        Always greater than actual
        Calculated as Input Distance / Output Distance
    Calculations
      Actual Mechanical Advantage Equation
        Output force / Input force
      Ideal Mechanical Advantage Equation
        Input Distance / Output Distance
    Examples
      Lever
        Juan's lever problem
          Input force: 30 N
          Input distance: 1 m
          Output distance: 0.2 m
      Ramp
        Input distance: 6 m
        Output distance: 2 m
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 3
        Another ramp
          Input distance: 8 m
          Output distance: 4 m
          Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 2
    Machine Characteristics
      Strength of Force
        Increases
        Decreases
        Stays the same
      Distance Over Force is Applied
        Decreases
        Increases
        Stays the same

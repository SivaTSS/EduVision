  Exothermic Reactions
    What is an exothermic reaction
      Definition: Chemical reaction releasing more energy than needed to break bonds
      Energy release: Often in the form of heat
    Why products are warmer
      Energy released as heat causes temperature rise
      Products are warmer than reactants
    Example of an exothermic reaction
      Combustion reactions
        Definition: Substance burns with oxygen
        Energy released: Heat and light
        Example: Burning wood in a bonfire
    Energy in chemical reactions
      Energy used to break bonds in reactants
      Energy released when new bonds form in products
    General equation
      Reactants â†’ Products + Energy

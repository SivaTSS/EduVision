  Heat Transfer in the Atmosphere
    What Powers Our Weather
      Solar Radiation
        Equator receives most
        Poles receive less
    Heat Transfer Mechanisms
      Conduction
        Direct contact
        Heat moves from hot to cold
        More effective at lower altitudes
      Convection
        Movement of heated materials
        Initiates convection cells
    Effects of Heat
      Causes wind
      Affects weather patterns
    Earth's Tilt
      Influences heating distribution
      Affects solar radiation received
    Atmospheric Circulation
      Driven by solar energy differences

  Enzymes in the Digestive System
    Digestive Enzymes
      Amylase
        Secreted in mouth
        Breaks down starch into sugars
      Pepsin
        Produced in stomach
        Breaks down proteins into amino acids
      Trypsin
        Produced in pancreas
        Breaks down proteins
      Pancreatic Lipase
        Produced in pancreas
        Breaks apart fats
      Nucleases
        Deoxyribonuclease
        Ribonuclease
        Break down nucleic acids
      Bile Salts
        Made in liver
        Break down fats
    Role of Enzymes
      Speed up chemical digestion
      Specific for reactions
      Reusable like tools
    Hormones in Digestion
      Chemical messengers
      Regulate digestive processes
      Examples
        Gastrin
          Signals gastric acid secretion
        Cholecystokinin
          Signals pancreatic enzyme secretion
        Secretin
          Signals water and bicarbonate secretion
        Ghrelin
          Signals hunger
        Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide
          Decreases gastric secretion
          Releases insulin

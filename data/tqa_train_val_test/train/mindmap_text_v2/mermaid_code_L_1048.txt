  Thermal Conductors and Insulators
    Thermal Conductors
      Definition
        Materials that conduct thermal energy well
      Examples
        Metals
        Metal radiator
    Thermal Insulators
      Definition
        Materials that conduct thermal energy poorly
      Examples
        Air
        Plastic
        Wood
        Down-filled snowsuits
        Insulation
    Conduction
      Definition
        Transfer of thermal energy between touching particles
      Process
        Warmer particles bump into cooler particles
      Speed
        Faster in solids and liquids than in gases
    Practical Uses
      Thermal Conductors
        Heating elements
        Radiators
      Thermal Insulators
        Clothing to retain heat
        Food and drink containers

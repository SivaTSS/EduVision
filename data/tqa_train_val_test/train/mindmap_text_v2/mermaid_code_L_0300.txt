  Seafloor Spreading Hypothesis
    Evidence
      Magnetic Stripes
        Pattern of magnetic polarity
        Symmetrical about mid-ocean ridges
      Seafloor Topography
        Flat-topped mountains (guyots)
        Deep sea trenches
    Key Contributors
      Harry Hess
        Geology professor and naval officer
        Discovered guyots and trenches
        Proposed seafloor spreading
      Bruce Heezen
        Discovered Great Global Rift
      Vine and Matthews
        Identified bands of magnetic polarity
    Concepts
      Mantle Convection
        Idea of Holmes
      Continental Drift
        Idea of Wegener
    Mechanism
      Magma at mid-ocean ridges
        Hot magma rises
        Lava cools and forms new crust
      Oceanic Crust Movement
        Spreads away from ridge
        Pushes continents apart
        Subduction at trenches
    Geological Implications
      Age of Seafloor
        Oldest crust at trenches
        Youngest crust at ridges
      Guyots
        Eroded volcanoes
        Moved deeper as seafloor spreads

  Conservation of Mass in Chemical Reactions
    Chemical Reactions
      Definition
        Change of substances
        Represented by chemical equations
    Importance of Balancing Equations
      Law of Conservation of Mass
        Matter cannot be created or destroyed
        Same mass in reactants and products
    Antoine Lavoisier
      Experiments in the 1700s
        Measured mass of reactants and products
        Conducted reactions in sealed jars
      Discovery of Oxygen
    Example Reaction
      Burning of Methane
        Equation: CH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O
        Balanced equation
          Same number of atoms on both sides
    Evidence of Mass Conservation
      Sealed jar importance
        Captured gases for measurement
        Prevented mass loss in results

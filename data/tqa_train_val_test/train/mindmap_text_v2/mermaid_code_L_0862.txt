  Doppler Effect
    Definition
      Change in frequency of sound waves
      Occurs when source is moving relative to listener
    Explanation
      Sound waves get closer together when source approaches listener
      Sound waves spread out when source moves away from listener
    Example: Police Car Siren
      Sound waves travel outward in all directions
      Waves bunched up in front, spread out behind
      Higher frequency = higher pitch
      Lower frequency = lower pitch
      Listener A hears higher pitch as car approaches
      Listener B hears lower pitch as car moves away
      Siren pitch drops after passing listener A

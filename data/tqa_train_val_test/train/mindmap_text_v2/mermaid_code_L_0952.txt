  Metals
    What are metals
      Elements that can conduct electricity
      Largest class of elements
      Solid at room temperature (except mercury)
    Properties of metals
      High melting points
      Good conductors of heat
      Shiny appearance
      Ductile
      Malleable
    Conductivity of metals
      Flow of electrons
      Tendency to give up electrons
      Example: Lithium
        Two electrons in first energy level
        One electron in second energy level
        Easier to give up one electron for stability

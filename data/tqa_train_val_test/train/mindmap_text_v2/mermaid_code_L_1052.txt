  Transfer of Electric Charge
    Charge Transfer Mechanisms
      Conduction
        Direct contact
        Example: Van de Graaff generator
        Example: Walking on wool carpet
      Polarization
        Movement of electrons within neutral objects
        Example: Touching a metal doorknob
      Friction
        Electrons transferred between materials
        Example: Rubbing balloon against hair
    Ions
      Cations
        Positively charged ions
        Formed by loss of electrons
      Anions
        Negatively charged ions
        Formed by gain of electrons
    Law of Conservation of Charge
      Total charge remains constant
      Electrons move but are not destroyed

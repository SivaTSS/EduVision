  Covalent Bonds
    Definition
      Covalent bonds share electrons
      Form between nonmetals
    Formation
      Atoms share pairs of electrons
      Atoms may be same or different
    Types of Covalent Bonds
      Polar Covalent Bonds
        Unequal sharing of electrons
        Slightly negative and positive charges
      Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
        Equal sharing of electrons
        Atoms remain neutral
    Properties of Covalent Compounds
      Low melting and boiling points
      Poor conductors of electricity
      Exist as individual molecules
      May not dissolve in water
    Polar vs Nonpolar Compounds
      Polar compounds have polar bonds
      Arrangement affects polarity
      Hydrogen bonds in polar compounds
    Examples
      Diatomic molecules (H2, O2)
      Water (H2O) as polar compound
      Carbon dioxide (CO2) as nonpolar compound
    Naming Covalent Compounds
      First element named first
      Second element gets suffix -ide
      Use of prefixes (di-, tri-)

  Chemical Equations
    Definition
      Symbolic representation of chemical reactions
      Example: C + O2 -> CO2
    Writing Chemical Equations
      Use of chemical symbols and formulas
      General form: Reactants -> Products
    Balancing Chemical Equations
      Importance of balancing
      Coefficients
        Definition: Number in front of chemical symbols
        Example: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O
      Steps to balance
        Count atoms in reactants and products
        Add coefficients
        Repeat until balanced
    Law of Conservation of Mass
      Matter cannot be created or destroyed
      Experiments by Antoine Lavoisier
        Measured mass of reactants and products
        Sealed jar experiments

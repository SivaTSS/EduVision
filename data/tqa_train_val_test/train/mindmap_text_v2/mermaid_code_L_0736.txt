  Energy Types
    Definition
      Ability to do work
      Measured in joules (J)
    Kinetic Energy
      Energy of moving matter
      Depends on mass and velocity
      Equation: KE = 1/2 mass * velocity^2
      Examples
        Hammer pounding a nail
        Moving objects in photos
    Potential Energy
      Energy stored due to position or shape
      Types
        Gravitational Potential Energy
          Depends on weight and height
          Equation: GPE = weight * height
          Example: Diver on diving board
        Elastic Potential Energy
          Energy from stretched or compressed objects
          Example: Rubber band, springs
    Energy Conversion
      Changes between potential and kinetic energy
      Law of conservation of energy
      Examples
        Diver jumping off board
        Swings and trampolines
    Mechanical Energy
      Combination of kinetic and potential energy
      Examples in everyday life

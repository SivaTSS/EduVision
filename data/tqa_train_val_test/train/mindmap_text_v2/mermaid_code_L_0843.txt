  Energy in Chemical Reactions
    Role of Energy
      Break bonds in reactants
      Release energy in products
    Law of Conservation of Energy
      Matter cannot be created or destroyed
      No overall change in energy
    Endothermic Reactions
      Absorb energy
      More stored chemical energy in products
      Energy stored in bonds of products
    Exothermic Reactions
      Release energy
      Less stored chemical energy in products
      Excess energy released to surroundings

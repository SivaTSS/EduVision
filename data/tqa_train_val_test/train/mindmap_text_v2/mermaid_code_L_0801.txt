  Artificial Light
    Types of Light Bulbs
      Incandescent
        Produces light by incandescence
        Contains tungsten filament
        Not energy efficient
      Fluorescent
        Produces light by fluorescence
        Contains mercury gas
        Coated with phosphor
      Neon
        Produces light by electroluminescence
        Contains neon gas
        Excited electrons emit light
      Vapor
        Produces light by electroluminescence
        Contains sodium or mercury
        Used for streetlights and stadiums
      LED
        Stands for light-emitting diode
        Contains semiconductor material
        Reliable and durable
    Comparison
      Incandescent vs Compact Fluorescent
        Incandescent wastes energy by producing heat
        CFL is more energy efficient

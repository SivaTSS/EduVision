  atomic forces
    electromagnetic force
      attraction between electrons and protons
      repulsion between protons
      force-carrying particles: photons
      charged particles: electrons (-1), protons (+1)
    strong nuclear force
      holds nucleus together
      attraction between quarks
      force-carrying particles: gluons
      overcomes electromagnetic repulsion
      limits on stable nuclei
    weak nuclear force
      changes subatomic particles
      force-carrying particles: W and Z bosons
      operates within the nucleus
      weaker than strong and electromagnetic forces
      alters element identity

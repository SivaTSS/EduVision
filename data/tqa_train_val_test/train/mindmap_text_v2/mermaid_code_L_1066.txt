  Wave Frequency
    Definition
      Number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time
    SI Unit
      Hertz (Hz)
      1 Hz = 1 wave per second
    Calculation
      Example: 10 waves in 5 seconds = 2 Hz
    Energy Relation
      Higher frequency = more energy
      Same amplitude comparison
    Measurement
      Counting crests in a time period
    Wavelength Relation
      Higher frequency = shorter wavelength
      Distance between adjacent crests
    Vibration Frequency
      Frequency of vibrations causes wave frequency
      Higher frequency requires quicker movements

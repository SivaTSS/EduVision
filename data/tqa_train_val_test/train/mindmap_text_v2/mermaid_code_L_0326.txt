  Testing Hypotheses
    Purpose of Scientific Method
      Create a hypothesis
      Understand machine workings
      Determine necessary information
      Test hypothesis validity
    Hypothesis Development
      Alternative hypothesis for CO2 rise
      Testing alternative hypothesis
      Implications of true hypothesis
      Role of multiple hypotheses
    Falsifiability in Science
      Discard incorrect hypotheses
      Example: CO2 rise due to fossil fuels
    Testing Hypotheses
      Review scientific literature
      Hypothesis 1: Volcanic CO2 emissions
        Increase in volcanic eruptions
        Changes in volcanic gas composition
        Findings: Constant eruptions, unchanged gas composition
        Conclusion: Hypothesis 1 is wrong
      Hypothesis 2: Fossil fuel burning
        Evidence from scientific literature
        Graph of global CO2 emissions
        Conclusion: Hypothesis 2 is true

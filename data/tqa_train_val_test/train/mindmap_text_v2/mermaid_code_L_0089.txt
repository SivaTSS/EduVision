  Acid Rain
    Causes
      Nitrogen and sulfur compounds
      Emissions from power plants and metal refineries
      Tall smokestacks
    Formation
      Combination with water vapor
      Creation of sulfuric and nitric acids
      Acid fog, rain, snow, and dry deposition
    Measurement
      pH scale
      Acid rain defined as pH less than 5.0
      Comparison with normal rain (pH 5.6)
      Impact of small pH changes on acidity
    Effects on Ecosystems
      Weakening of plants and animals
      Impact on food chains (e.g., snails and songbirds)
      Acidic lakes and loss of fish
      Damage to crops, especially in poorer nations
    Cultural Impact
      Damage to monuments and buildings
      Examples: U.S. Capitol, Westminster Abbey
    Regional Variations
      Areas with carbonate rocks vs. non-carbonate rocks
      Transboundary pollution issues
      Examples: Sweden, Canada, Southeast Asia
    Solutions
      International cooperation to reduce emissions
      Use of carbonate rocks for neutralization

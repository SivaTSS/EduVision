  Isomers
    Definition
      Hydrocarbons with same atoms, different shapes
      Different properties due to different arrangements
    Hydrocarbons
      Compounds of carbon and hydrogen
      Smallest: Methane (CH4)
      Larger hydrocarbons have more isomers
    Butane
      Chemical formula: C4H10
      Isomers: n-butane, iso-butane
    Pentane
      Chemical formula: C5H12
      Isomers: n-pentane, iso-pentane, neo-pentane
    Heptane
      Chemical formula: C7H16
      Isomers: 9
    Dodecane
      Chemical formula: C12H26
      Isomers: 355
    Properties of Isomers
      Branched-chain vs straight-chain
      Boiling and melting points
      Example: iso-butane vs n-butane

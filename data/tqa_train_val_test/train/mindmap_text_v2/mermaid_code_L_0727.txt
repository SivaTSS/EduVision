  Newtons First Law of Motion
    Definition
      States that an object's motion will not change unless an unbalanced force acts on it
      If at rest, stays at rest
      If in motion, stays in motion
    Inertia
      Tendency to resist change in motion
      Depends on mass
        Greater mass = greater inertia
    Unbalanced Force
      Must be applied to overcome inertia
      Causes acceleration
    Examples
      Skateboard hitting a curb
      Pool balls on a table
      Amusement park ride
    Importance of Seat Belts
      Inertia causes bodies to move forward in a sudden stop
    Relationship to Mass
      Mass affects inertia and acceleration

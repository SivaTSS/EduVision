  Using Thermal Energy
    Home Heating Systems
      Hot-Water Heating System
        Heats water
        Pumps hot water through pipes
        Uses radiators to transfer thermal energy
        Cycle of heating and cooling
      Warm-Air Heating System
        Heats air
        Forces warm air through ducts
        Uses fans for circulation
    Cooling Systems
      Refrigerators
        Transfers thermal energy from cool air to warm air
        Uses refrigerant to absorb and release thermal energy
      Air Conditioners
        Reverses normal heat flow
        Maintains cool temperatures
    Combustion Engines
      External Combustion Engine
        Burns fuel outside the engine
        Uses steam pressure to move pistons
      Internal Combustion Engine
        Burns fuel inside the engine
        Series of steps involving fuel-air mixture and piston movement

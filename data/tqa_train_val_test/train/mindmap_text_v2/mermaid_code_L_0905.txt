  Friction
    Definition
      Opposes motion between touching surfaces
      Occurs due to imperfect surface smoothness
    Factors Affecting Friction
      Surface roughness
        Rougher surfaces have more friction
        Smoother surfaces have less friction
      Weight of objects
        Heavier objects press together with greater force
    Effects of Friction
      Produces heat
        Molecules move faster, increasing energy
        Rubbing hands together warms them
      Can be beneficial
        Increases grip (e.g., sand on icy sidewalks)
        Useful in lighting matches
      Can be problematic
        Excessive friction in engines causes wear
        Can lead to overheating
    Reducing Friction
      Use of lubricants (e.g., oil in engines)
      Making surfaces smoother

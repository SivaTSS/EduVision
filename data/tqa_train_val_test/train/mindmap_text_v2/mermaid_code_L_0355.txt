  Weathering and Erosion
    What is Weathering
      Definition: Breaks down Earth materials into smaller pieces
      Process: Changes solid rock into sediments
    Difference from Erosion
      Weathering: Breaks down materials
      Erosion: Transports sediments to other locations
    Time Factor
      Gradual Process: Takes a long time
      Example: Mountains worn down to hills and plains
    Effects on Landscapes
      Modification: Changes Earth's surface over time
      Example: Appalachian Mountains vs. Himalayas
    Human Observation
      Long-term Changes: Not observable in real-time
      Short-term Changes: Visible over years (e.g., road wear)
    Weathering Forces
      Types: Cracks, fractures, potholes
      Impact: Gradual wear of roads, rocks, and mountains

  Speed
    Definition
      How fast or slow something moves
      SI unit: meters per second (m/s)
    Average Speed
      Formula: speed = distance time
      Example: 120 miles in 3 hours = 40 mi/h
      Calculation for distance: distance = speed time
      Calculation for time: time = distance speed
    Instantaneous Speed
      Speed at any given instant
      More difficult to calculate than average speed
    Variability
      Speed may be constant or vary
      Factors affecting speed: speed limits, traffic lights, number of vehicles
    Example Scenarios
      Terri's bike trip: 6 km in 0.25 h = 24 km/h
      Car trip: 65 mi/h on highway, 20 mi/h in city

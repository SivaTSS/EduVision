      Definition
      Role in Marine Transgressions and Regressions
    Marine Transgression
      Causes
        Land sinking
        Water level rising
      Characteristics
        Sea level rises
        Rock layers: sandstone, shale, limestone
    Marine Regression
      Causes
        Increase in glaciers
        Land uplift
      Characteristics
        Sea level retreats
        Rock layers: reverse of transgression
    Geological Evidence
      Grand Canyon Record
        Incomplete record of transgressions and regressions
        Six cycles during Phanerozoic
      Paleozoic Evidence
        Four complete cycles
        Two additional cycles in Mesozoic

  Rocks and Processes of the Rock Cycle
    Types of Rocks
      Igneous
        Formation from cooling magma
        Types based on cooling rate
      Sedimentary
        Formation from compaction and cementation
        Includes chemical precipitates
      Metamorphic
        Formation from heat and pressure

  gamma decay
    gamma rays
      definition
        electromagnetic waves
        carry photons of energy
        most energetic electromagnetic waves
      production
        during gamma decay of excited nucleus
        emitted as gamma particles
    gamma decay process
      emission of energy
        packet of energy called gamma particle
      comparison with other decays
        alpha decay
          emits particles and energy
        beta decay
          emits particles and energy
        only energy emitted in gamma decay
    reasons for gamma decay
      unstable nucleus
        radioactive elements
        excited state of nucleus
        occurs after alpha or beta decay
      stability
        no change in number of protons
        atom remains the same element
    dangers of gamma rays
      penetration ability
        travel farther than alpha and beta particles
        require lead or concrete for shielding
      biological impact
        can damage cells deep inside the body

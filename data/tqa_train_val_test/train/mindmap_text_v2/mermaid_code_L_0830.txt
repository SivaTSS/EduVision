  Chemical Equations
    Definition
      Shorthand for chemical reactions
      Summarizes reactants and products
    Parts of a Chemical Equation
      Reactants
        Substances that begin the reaction
        Placed on the left side
      Products
        Substances produced in the reaction
        Placed on the right side
      Arrow
        Indicates direction of reaction
      Plus Signs
        Separate multiple reactants or products
      Coefficients
        Numbers showing amount of each substance
    Writing Chemical Equations
      Use of chemical symbols and formulas
      Example: C + O2 → CO2
    Balancing Chemical Equations
      Same number of each type of atom on both sides
      Law of conservation of mass
      Example: 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3
    Chemical Reaction Example
      Calcium Carbonate Reaction
        CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
      Iron Rusting Reaction
        Iron + Oxygen → Iron Oxide

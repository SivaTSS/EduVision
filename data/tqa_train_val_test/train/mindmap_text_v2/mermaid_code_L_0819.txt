  Work Calculation
    Equation
      Work = Force x Distance
    SI Unit
      Joule (J)
      Newton meter (N m)
      Definition
        1 J = 1 N moving 1 m
    Example 1
      Clarissa lifts mower
        Force = 200 N
        Distance = 1.1 m
        Work = 220 J
    Example 2
      Clarissa raises herself
        Work = 528 J
        Weight = ?
    Example 3
      Clarissa mows grandmother's lawn
        Force = 100 N
        Distance = 200 m
        Work = 20,000 J
    Example 4
      Clarissa mows neighbor's lawn
        Distance = 234 m
        Work = 23,400 J
    Rearranging Equation
      Force = Work / Distance
      Distance = Work / Force
    Example 5
      Clarissa pushes mower home
        Work = 2700 J
        Distance = 30 m
        Force = 90 N
    Example 6
      Lifting mower in garage
        Work = 400 J
        Force = 200 N
        Distance = ?

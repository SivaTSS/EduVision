  Efficiency
    Output_Work
      Definition: Work done by the machine
      Always_Less_Than_Input_Work: True
    Input_Work
      Definition: Work put into the machine by the user
      Example: 5000 joules input for 4000 joules output
    Efficiency_Calculation
      Formula: Efficiency = (Output / Input) x 100%
      Example_1: 6000 J output from 8000 J input = 75%
      Example_2: 6700 J output from 7500 J input = 90%
    Friction
      Definition: Force opposing motion between surfaces
      Impact_on_Work: Reduces output work
    Machines
      Definition: Devices that make work easier
      Example: Dolly and ramp
      Characteristics: Do not increase total work done

  Classes of Elements
    Metals
      Properties
        Good conductors of electricity
        Shiny, ductile, malleable
        High melting points
        Solid at room temperature (except mercury)
      Examples
        Sodium (Na)
        Silver (Ag)
        Zinc (Zn)
    Nonmetals
      Properties
        Poor conductors of electricity
        Dull and brittle
        Gases at room temperature (most)
        Low boiling points
      Examples
        Helium (He)
        Carbon (C)
        Oxygen (O)
    Metalloids
      Properties
        Properties of both metals and nonmetals
        Can conduct electricity at certain temperatures
        Shiny but brittle
        Solid at room temperature
      Examples
        Boron (B)
        Silicon (Si)
        Germanium (Ge)
    Valence Electrons
      Definition
        Electrons in the outer energy level
      Relation to Reactivity
        Metals: few valence electrons, very reactive
        Metalloids: half-full outer level, less reactive
        Nonmetals: nearly full outer level, very reactive

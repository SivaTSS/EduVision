  Wave Speed
    Definition
      Distance a wave travels in a given time
      Measured in meters per second
    Equation
      Speed = Wavelength x Frequency
      Can be rearranged to solve for wavelength or frequency
    Wavelength
      Distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves
    Wave Frequency
      Number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time
      Measured in hertz (Hz)
    Relationship
      Increasing wavelength decreases frequency
      Speed remains constant
    Medium
      Speed depends on the medium
      Fastest in solids, slowest in gases
    Examples
      Ocean wave: Wavelength = 3m, Frequency = 1Hz, Speed = 3m/s
      Spring wave: Wavelength = 0.1m, Frequency = 2Hz, Speed = 0.2m/s

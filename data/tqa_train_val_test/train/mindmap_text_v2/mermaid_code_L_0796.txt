  Alkaline Earth Metals
    Definition
      Group 2 elements
      Silvery or gray color
      Soft and low density
    Reactivity
      Very reactive
      Give up two valence electrons
      Increases from top to bottom
      Comparison with alkali metals
        Less reactive than alkali metals
        More energy needed to remove two electrons
    Examples
      Calcium
        Needed for strong bones
        Most abundant metal in human body
        Compounds: calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate
        Health issues from deficiency
          Rickets in children
          Osteoporosis in adults
      Strontium
        Silver-colored
        Uses: fireworks, cement, toothpaste
        Produces red explosions in fireworks
        Reduces tooth sensitivity in toothpaste

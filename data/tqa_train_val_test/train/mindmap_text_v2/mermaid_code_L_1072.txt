  Wedge
    What is a wedge
      Definition: Simple machine with two inclined planes
      Structure: Thin end and thick end
    How does a wedge change the force
      Force applied to thick end
      Sloping sides apply force to object
      Makes work easier
    Machines that include a wedge
      Examples: axe, hammer, bolt, file
    Mechanical advantage of a wedge
      Greater than 1
      Ratio of output force to input force
      Longer, thinner wedges have greater advantage
      Trade-off: output force over shorter distance

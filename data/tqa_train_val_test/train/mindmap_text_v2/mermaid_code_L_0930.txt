    Definition
      Ion
        Positive or Negative Charge
        Unequal Protons and Electrons
    Types of Ions
      Cations
        Positive Ions
        Example: Sodium Ion (Na+)
      Anions
        Negative Ions
        Example: Fluoride Ion (F-)
    Ion Formation
      Ionization
        Gain or Lose Electrons
        Exposure to Radiation
        Electron Transfer
    Properties of Ions
      Reactive
      Attracted to Opposite Charges
      Repelled by Same Charges
      Deflected by Magnetic Field
    Examples
      Fluorine Atom
        Gains Electron to Become Fluoride Ion (F-)
      Sodium Atom
        Loses Electron to Become Sodium Ion (Na+)
      Iron Ions
        Iron(II) Ion (Fe2+)
        Iron(III) Ion (Fe3+)
    Reactions
      Forming Neutral Compounds
        Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

  stratosphere
    temperature
      increases with altitude
      heat source is the Sun
    ozone layer
      protects from UV light
      higher concentration of ozone
      created by solar energy
      unstable and cycles
    mixing
      little mixing with troposphere
      stable air due to temperature gradient
    features
      tops the stratosphere
      important for life on Earth
    natural cycle
      creates and destroys ozone molecules
      UV radiation splits oxygen molecules
      ozone formation releases heat

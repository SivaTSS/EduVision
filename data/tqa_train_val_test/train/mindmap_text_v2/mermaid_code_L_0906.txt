    discovery timeline
      1803: John Dalton discovers the atom
      1897: J.J. Thomson discovers the electron
      1905: Albert Einstein discovers the photon
      1911: Ernest Rutherford discovers the proton
      1932: James Chadwick discovers the neutron
      1964: Murray Gell-Mann proposes quarks
    types of fundamental particles
      quarks
        types: up, down
        properties: mass, electric charge (+2/3, -1/3), color charge
        combinations: protons (2 up, 1 down), neutrons (2 down, 1 up)
      leptons
        types: six types including electrons
        properties: mass, electric charge (-1, 0)
      bosons
        types: gluons, W bosons, Z bosons, photons, gravitons (hypothetical)
        properties: force-carrying, mass (some massless)
    standard model
      explanation: matter and interactions
      limitations: does not explain gravity, mass of matter
    fundamental forces
      types: gravity, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, strong nuclear
      bosons: transmit forces
      examples: gluons (strong nuclear force), photons (electromagnetic force)

  Water Cycle
    Definition
      Continuous process
      Movement of water
    Key Processes
      Evaporation
        Water from oceans
      Condensation
        Formation of clouds
      Precipitation
        Rain, snow, hail
      Surface Runoff
        Water flows over land
      Infiltration
        Water enters ground
      Groundwater Storage
        Stored in aquifers
      Surface Water Storage
        Lakes, rivers, reservoirs
      Evapotranspiration
        Water vapor from plants
    Differences from Nutrient Cycles
      Water is recycled
      Energy flows through ecosystems
    Importance
      Essential for life
      Supports biological productivity
    Relationship with Biogeochemical Cycles
      Involves biotic and abiotic components
      Other cycles: carbon, nitrogen

  Transition Metals
    What are transition metals
      Groups 3-12 of periodic table
      More than half of all elements
    Properties of transition metals
      Superior conductors of electricity and heat
      Luster, malleability, ductility
      High melting and boiling points
      High density
      Generally solid at room temperature (except mercury)
      Colorful compounds
    Differences from other metals
      Less reactive than alkali metals (group 1)
      Less reactive than alkaline Earth metals (group 2)
      Resist corrosion
    Unique characteristics
      Use of electrons in next to highest and highest energy levels
      Similar properties with different valence electrons
      Produce magnetic fields (iron, cobalt, nickel)
    Lanthanides and actinides
      Lanthanides
        Follow lanthanum (La)
        Relatively reactive
      Actinides
        Follow actinium (Ac)
        Radioactive
        Often made in laboratories

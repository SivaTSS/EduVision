  Calculating Acceleration
    Equation for Acceleration
      Formula: acceleration = v t
    SI Unit
      Unit: m/s2
    Average Acceleration
      Definition: Change in velocity divided by change in time
      Example 1
        Scenario: Cyclist increases velocity from 4 m/s to 7 m/s
        Time: 5 seconds
        Calculation: (7 m/s - 4 m/s) / 5 s = 0.6 m/s2
      Example 2
        Scenario: Cyclist speeds up from 1 m/s to 6 m/s
        Time: 5 seconds
        Calculation: (6 m/s - 1 m/s) / 5 s = 1 m/s2
      Example 3
        Scenario: Cyclist slows down from 6 m/s to 2 m/s
        Time: 4 seconds
        Calculation: (2 m/s - 6 m/s) / 4 s = -1 m/s2

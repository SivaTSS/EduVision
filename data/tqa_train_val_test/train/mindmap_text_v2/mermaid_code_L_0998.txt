  Radioactive Decay
    What is Radioactive Decay
      Definition: Unstable nuclei emit charged particles and energy
      Purpose: Become stable
    Types of Radioactive Decay
      Alpha Decay
        Emission: Alpha particle (2 protons and 2 neutrons) + energy
        Effect: Changes element, least damaging
        Travel: Few centimeters in air, can burn skin
      Beta Decay
        Emission: Beta particle (1 electron or 1 positron) + energy
        Effect: Changes element, penetrates and damages skin
        Travel: Up to a meter in air
      Gamma Decay
        Emission: Energy (gamma ray)
        Effect: Does not change element, most damaging
        Travel: Thousands of meters in air, penetrates deep into body
    Comparison of Decay Types
      Alpha vs Beta vs Gamma
        Alpha and Beta: Change element
        Gamma: No change in element
        Damage Level: Alpha < Beta < Gamma
    Impact on Living Things
      Harmful Effects: Charged particles and energy can damage living organisms

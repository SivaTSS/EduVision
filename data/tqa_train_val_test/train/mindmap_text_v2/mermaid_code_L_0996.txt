  Pulley
    Definition
      Simple machine
      Rope and grooved wheel
      Used to lift loads
    Types of Pulleys
      Fixed Pulley
        Attached to a secure surface
        Example: Flagpole pulley
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 1
      Moveable Pulley
        Attached to the object being moved
        Example: Zip-line pulley
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 2
      Compound Pulley
        Combination of fixed and moveable pulleys
        Example: Crane pulley
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 2 or greater
    Mechanical Advantage
      Changes force applied
      Ideal vs Actual Mechanical Advantage
        Ideal: No friction
        Actual: Overcomes friction
      Calculation
        Equal to number of rope segments
        More segments = less force needed
    Applications
      Lifting heavy objects
      Example: Lifting buckets from a well

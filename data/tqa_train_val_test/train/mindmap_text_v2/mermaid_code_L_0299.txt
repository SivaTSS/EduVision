  Scientific Models
    Definition
      Representation of complex systems
      Easier manipulation than real systems
      Used for predictions
      Types: physical, conceptual, mathematical
    Importance
      Useful tools in science
      Help understand complex systems
      Allow analysis and predictions
    Climate Models
      Represent Earth's complex climate
      Factors are interdependent
      Example: CO2 levels and plant growth
    Validation
      Testing ideas through manipulation
      Historical data for accuracy
      Predicting present to assess future predictions
    Limitations
      Simpler than real systems
      May not predict behavior accurately
      Accuracy depends on computing power and construction
    Types of Models
      Physical Models
        Smaller, simpler representations
        Examples: globe, map
      Conceptual Models
        Tie together ideas to explain phenomena
      Mathematical Models
        Sets of equations for representation
        Typically done on computers

  Chemical Reactions
    Reactants
      Definition: Substances that start a chemical reaction
      Example: Fuel (candlewick and wax) + Oxygen
    Products
      Definition: Substances produced in a chemical reaction
      Example: Carbon dioxide gas + Water vapor
    Chemical Equation
      General Form: Reactants → Products
      Direction: Arrow indicates reaction direction
      Combustion Reaction: Fuel + O2 → CO2 + H2O
    Process of Reaction
      Bonds break in reactants
      New bonds form in products
      Atoms rearranged into different combinations
    Example Reaction
      Reactants: Hydrogen (H2) + Oxygen (O2)
      Product: Water (H2O)
      Animation: Identify reactants and products
    Image Explanation
      Components: Water (H2O), Oxygen (O2), Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)
      Flow: Arrows indicate reactants and products
      Complexity: Smaller molecules present in the reaction

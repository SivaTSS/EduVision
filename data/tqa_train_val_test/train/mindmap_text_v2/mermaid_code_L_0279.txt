  principle of uniformitarianism
    Earth scientist needs
      answer questions about Earth's past
    James Hutton
      father of geology
      recognized the present is key to the past
      proposed principle in late 1700s
    principle of uniformitarianism
      understanding geological processes today
      applying to past events
      example: ancient lava rock in sandstone
    Checkerboard Mesa
      located in Zion National Park, Utah
      Navajo sandstone formation
      analysis of rock chemistry
      observations to understand formation
    geological processes
      slow natural processes shape landscape
      examples: erosion by streams, sediment accumulation
    cross-bedding
      caused by changes in wind direction
      observed in Mesquite sand dune, Death Valley
      explains formation of Navajo sandstone
    geologists' methods
      use current observations to interpret past events
      examples: rocks from volcanoes, oceans, rivers

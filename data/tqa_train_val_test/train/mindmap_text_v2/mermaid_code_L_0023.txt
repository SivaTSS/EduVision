  Atmosphere Layers
    Temperature Changes
      Decreases with altitude in troposphere
      Increases with altitude in stratosphere
      Decreases with altitude in mesosphere
      Increases with altitude in thermosphere
    Troposphere
      Lowest layer
      Weather occurs here
      Temperature decreases with altitude
      Contains 75% of atmospheric gas
      Convection cells cause air mixing
      Temperature inversion phenomenon
    Stratosphere
      Above troposphere
      Temperature increases with altitude
      Contains ozone layer
      Ozone absorbs UV radiation
      Stratopause as boundary to mesosphere
    Mesosphere
      Above stratosphere
      Temperature decreases with altitude
      Few gas molecules
      Meteors burn up here
      Mesopause as boundary to thermosphere
    Thermosphere
      Above mesosphere
      Temperature increases with altitude
      Very few gas molecules
      Ions create auroras
      International Space Station orbits here
    Exosphere
      Highest layer
      Merges with outer space
      Gas molecules far apart
      Weak gravity allows molecules to escape

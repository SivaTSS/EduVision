  Nonmetals
    Definition
      Elements that do not conduct electricity
      Second largest class of elements
    Properties
      Low boiling points
      Poor conductors of heat
      Dull and brittle solids
      Gases at room temperature
    Examples
      Hydrogen
      Carbon
      Chlorine
      Helium
    Reactivity
      Varies among nonmetals
      Depends on number of valence electrons
      Reactive nonmetals gain electrons
    Periodic Table Position
      Located on the right side
      More electrons in outer energy level
    Comparison with Metals
      Different properties from metals
      Nonmetals are less reactive than metals
    Valence Electrons
      Electrons in outer energy level
      Determine chemical reactivity
      Example: Fluorine vs Neon
        Fluorine is more reactive
        Neon is stable and nonreactive

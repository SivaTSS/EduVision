      Origin from wind
      Factors for large waves
        Strong wind
        Long duration
        Long distance
      Energy transfer
        Tiny ripples to larger waves
        Molecules not the same at shore
    Wave Motion
      Circular motion in deep water
      Elliptical motion in shallow water

  Thermal Energy Transfer
    Conduction
      Definition: Transfer of thermal energy between touching particles
      Thermal Conductors: Materials that conduct thermal energy well
        Examples: Metals
      Thermal Insulators: Materials that do not conduct thermal energy well
        Examples: Plastic, Wood
    Convection
      Definition: Transfer of thermal energy by particles moving through a fluid
      Convection Currents: Loops of moving particles
      Examples: Soup heating in a pot, Air currents
    Radiation
      Definition: Transfer of thermal energy by waves through empty space
      Examples: Sun warming Earth, Campfire warming people
    Insulation
      Purpose: Keeps thermal energy from escaping or entering
      Materials: Fluffy insulation, Down jackets
    Applications
      Heating Homes: Devices and systems involved
      Running Vehicles: How thermal energy powers cars

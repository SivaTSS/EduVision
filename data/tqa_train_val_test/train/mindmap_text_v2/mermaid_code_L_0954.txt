    Types of Mirrors
      Plane Mirror
        Characteristics: Flat reflective surface
        Image: Virtual, right-side up, life-sized, left-right reversed
      Concave Mirror
        Characteristics: Shaped like the inside of a bowl
        Image: Can be real or virtual, depends on object position relative to focal point
      Convex Mirror

        Image: Only virtual, right-side up, reduced in size
    Focal Point
      Definition: Point where reflected rays meet
      Importance: Determines type of image formed by concave mirrors
    Applications of Mirrors
      Street Intersections: Convex mirrors for visibility around corners
      Car Headlights: Concave mirrors to focus light
      Telescopes: Use of concave mirrors for image formation

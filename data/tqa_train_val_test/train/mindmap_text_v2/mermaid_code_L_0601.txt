  Microscopes
    Purpose
      Tool for magnifying small objects
      Important in biology
    Types
      Light Microscopes
        Uses lenses to focus light
        Magnification up to 2000x
      Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEM)
        Uses electron beams
        Magnification up to 2 million times
      Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)
        Scans surface with electron beams
        Magnification from 10 to 500,000 times
      Scanning Acoustic Microscopes
        Uses sound waves for scanning

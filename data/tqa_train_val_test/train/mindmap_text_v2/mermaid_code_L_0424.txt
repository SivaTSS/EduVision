  Photosynthesis
    Definition
      Process of making glucose using light energy
      Requires water and carbon dioxide
      Produces oxygen as a byproduct
    Photosynthetic Organisms
      Plants
      Algae
      Some bacteria
    Chloroplast
      Structure
        Surrounded by two membranes
        Contains thylakoids with chlorophyll
        Stroma filled with fluid
      Function
        Site of photosynthesis
    Stages of Photosynthesis
      Light Reactions
        Occur in thylakoids
        Capture light energy
        Produce ATP and NADPH
        Use water and produce oxygen
      Calvin Cycle
        Occur in stroma
        Use ATP and NADPH to produce glucose
        Use carbon dioxide
    Energy Flow
      Begins with photosynthesis
      Glucose as energy source for cells
    Autotrophs vs Heterotrophs
      Autotrophs
        Make glucose (self feeders)
        Examples: plants, algae
      Heterotrophs
        Obtain glucose by consuming autotrophs (other feeders)
        Examples: animals, fungi
    Raw Materials for Photosynthesis
      Light
      Water
      Carbon dioxide
      Absorbed through leaves and stomata

      System of glands
      Releases hormones into bloodstream
    Hormones
      Chemical messengers
      Travel slowly compared to nerve impulses
      Affect target cells
    Glands
      Hypothalamus
        Connects nervous and endocrine systems
        Secretes hormones to pituitary
      Pituitary Gland
        Master gland
        Controls other endocrine glands
        Secretes various hormones
      Thyroid Gland
        Secretes thyroxin
        Regulates metabolism
      Adrenal Glands
        Secrete adrenaline
        Respond to emergencies
      Pancreas
        Secretes insulin
        Regulates glucose levels
      Gonads
        Testes (male)
          Secrete testosterone
        Ovaries (female)
          Secrete estrogen
    Target Cells
      Specific cells affected by hormones
      Have proteins for hormone binding
    Hormone Regulation
      Negative feedback loops
        Control hormone secretion
        Example: Thyroid hormone regulation
    Diseases
      Hypothyroidism
        Insufficient hormone secretion
      Gigantism
        Excess growth hormone
      Type 1 Diabetes
        Immune system attacks insulin-producing cells

  Chemical Bonding
    Ionic Bond
      Definition: Electrons transferred between atoms
      Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl)
      Sodium: 1 valence electron
      Chlorine: 7 valence electrons
      Sodium Ion Charge: +1
      Chlorine Ion Charge: -1
    Covalent Bond
      Definition: Atoms share electrons
      Example: Methane (CH4)
      Strong bonds: Requires energy to break
      Oxygen: 6 valence electrons
      Hydrogen: 1 valence electron
    Hydrogen Bond
      Definition: Weak bond between polar molecules
      Example: Water
      Polarity: Slightly positive and negative sides
    Comparison
      Covalent vs Ionic: Sharing vs Transferring electrons
      Strength: Covalent bonds are stronger
      Hydrogen Bond: Relatively weak

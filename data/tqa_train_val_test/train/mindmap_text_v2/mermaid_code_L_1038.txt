  Static Electricity and Static Discharge
    What is Static Electricity
      Buildup of electric charges on objects
      Transfer of electrons between objects
    How Static Discharge Occurs
      Sudden flow of electrons
      Examples: lightning, electric shock
    Process of Charge Buildup
      Friction between materials
      Example: rubber shoes on wool mat
      Positive and negative charge formation
    Conditions for Charge Retention
      Charges remain until touching another object
      Difficulty of charge travel through dry air
    Static Discharge Example: Metal Doorknocker
      Negatively charged hand repels electrons
      Positive charge on knocker side
      Sudden flow of electrons creates spark
    Static Discharge Example: Lightning
      Charge buildup in clouds during storms
      Negative charges at cloud base, positive at top
      Discharge as bolts of lightning

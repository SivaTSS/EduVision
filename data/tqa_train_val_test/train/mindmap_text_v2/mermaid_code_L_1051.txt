  J. J. Thomson's Atomic Model
    Discovery of the Electron
      Year: 1897
      Method: Cathode Ray Tube
        Components: Cathode, Anode
        Hypotheses: Energy ray vs. stream of particles
        Findings: Cathode ray repelled by negative plate, attracted by positive plate
    Thomson's Inference
      Particles: Corpuscles (later named electrons)
      Mass: 2000 times smaller than hydrogen atom
      Neutrality of Atoms: Positively charged particles cancel negative charge
    Plum Pudding Model
      Description: Positive charge sphere with negative electrons scattered
      Analogy: Original analogy for plum pudding model
    Rejection of Model
      Reason: Discovery of nucleus concentrated positive charge
      Modern Understanding: Electrons swirl around nucleus in empty space
    Thomson's Background
      Birthplace: England
      Education: Cambridge University
      Nobel Prize: 1906 for research on gas conductivity

  Introduction to Chemical Reactions
    Chemical Change
      Definition: Matter changes into a different substance
      Evidence of Chemical Change
        Change in color
        Change in temperature
        Production of gas
        Formation of precipitate
    Chemical Reaction
      Definition: Process where substances change into different substances
      Reactants and Products
        Reactants: Substances that start a reaction
        Products: Substances produced in a reaction
      Bond Changes
        Bonds break in reactants
        New bonds form in products
    Equilibrium
      Definition: Balance between opposing changes
      Indicators of Equilibrium
        No overall change in reactants and products
    Examples of Chemical Reactions
      Vinegar and baking soda reaction
      Hydrogen and oxygen forming water
      Reverse reaction of water to hydrogen and oxygen
    Non-Chemical Changes
      Changes of state (e.g., freezing, evaporating)
      No bonds broken, no new products formed

    Definition
      Push or pull acting on an object
      Examples
        Friction
        Gravity
        Applied force
    Properties
      Vector
        Size
        Direction
      SI Unit
        Newton (N)
        1 N = 1 kg * m/sÂ²
    Net Force
      Combined forces acting on an object
      Calculation
        Opposite directions
          Subtract forces
        Same direction
          Add forces
      Examples
        Balanced forces
          Net force = 0
        Unbalanced forces
          Net force > 0
    Relation to Motion
      Changes in motion
        Stationary to moving

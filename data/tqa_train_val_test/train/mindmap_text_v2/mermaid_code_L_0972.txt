  Nucleic Acid Classification
    Nucleic Acids
      Definition
        One of four classes of biochemical molecules
        Includes RNA and DNA
      Elements
        Carbon
        Hydrogen
        Oxygen
        Nitrogen
        Phosphorus
      Structure
        Nucleotides
          Phosphate group
          Sugar
            Deoxyribose in DNA
            Ribose in RNA
          Nitrogen bases
            DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
            RNA: Adenine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine
    Types of Nucleic Acids
      RNA
        Single nucleotide chain
        Copies genetic code
        Synthesizes proteins
      DNA
        Double nucleotide chain
        Stores genetic information
        Instructs protein synthesis
    Bonds
      Covalent bonds
        Hold nucleotides together
      Hydrogen bonds
        Form between nitrogen bases
        Adenine with Thymine
        Guanine with Cytosine
    Structure Comparison
      DNA as a double helix
        Backbone of sugars and phosphates
        Base pairs as steps of a staircase

  Metallic Bonding
    Definition
      Metallic bonds are attractions between positive metal ions and valence electrons
      Valence electrons move freely
    Properties of Metals
      Conduct electricity
      Bend without breaking
      Ductile and malleable
    Lattice Structure
      Strong and flexible arrangement of metal ions
    Formation of Metallic Bonds
      Occurs in metals due to easy loss of valence electrons
      Nonmetals share electrons and do not form ions
    Demonstration
      Use of an empty pop can to show bending without breaking
    Heating Metals
      Heating allows metal ions to move and bend without cracking

  Radio Waves
    What are radio waves
      Definition
      Characteristics
        Longest wavelengths
        Lowest frequencies
        Least energy
    AM vs FM Radio
      AM (Amplitude Modulation)
        Encoding method
        Longer wavelengths
        Reflects off ionosphere
        Greater distance at night
      FM (Frequency Modulation)
        Encoding method
        Shorter wavelengths
        Does not reflect off ionosphere
        Clearer sound quality
    Radio Waves in Television
      Encoding methods
        Sounds: Frequency Modulation
        Pictures: Amplitude Modulation
      Broadcasting process
        From TV tower
        Decoding by television sets
    Electromagnetic Spectrum
      Definition
      Range of frequencies
        10^5 to 10^12 Hz
      Other electromagnetic waves

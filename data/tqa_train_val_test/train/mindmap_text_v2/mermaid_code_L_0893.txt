  Energy Levels
    Definition
      Fixed distances from nucleus
      Electrons found in these levels
    Energy and Electrons
      Higher levels = more energy
      Electrons added to lowest levels first
    Maximum Electrons
      Depends on orbitals
      Energy Level I: 2 electrons
      Energy Level II: 8 electrons
      Energy Level III: 18 electrons
      Energy Level IV: 32 electrons
    Orbitals
      Volume of space for electrons
      Types: S orbitals (spherical), P orbitals (dumbbell)
      Maximum of 2 electrons per orbital
    Valence Electrons
      Outermost energy level
      Determine reactivity and properties
      Stability with full outer level
    Electron Transitions
      Absorb energy to jump levels
      Release energy as light when falling back
    Examples
      Sodium atom with 11 electrons
      Fluorine and lithium reactivity
      Neon atom stability

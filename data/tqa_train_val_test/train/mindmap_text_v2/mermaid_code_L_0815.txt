  Buoyancy
    Buoyant Force
      Definition: Upward force exerted by fluids
      Occurrence: Greater pressure below than above
    Factors Affecting Buoyancy
      Weight
        Measure of gravitational force
        Determines if an object sinks or floats
      Density
        Mass in a given volume
        Denser substances weigh more
        Example: Ice vs. water
    Predictions and Examples
      Ice Cube vs. Rock
        Ice cube floats
        Rock sinks
      Other Examples
        Oil floats on water
        Helium balloons float in air

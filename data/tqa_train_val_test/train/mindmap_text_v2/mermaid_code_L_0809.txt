  Biochemical Compound Classification
    What is a biochemical compound?
      Definition: Carbon-based compounds in living things
      Importance: Evidence for evolution from common ancestors
    General description of a biochemical molecule
      Composition: Contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur
      Structure: Mostly polymers and macromolecules
    Four classes of biochemical compounds
      Carbohydrates
        Elements: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
        Examples: Sugars, starches, cellulose
        Functions: Provide energy to cells, store energy in plants
      Proteins
        Elements: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur
        Examples: Enzymes, hormones
        Functions: Speed up biochemical reactions, regulate life processes
      Lipids
        Elements: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
        Functions: Store energy in animals and plants, make up cell walls
      Nucleic acids
        Elements: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus
        Examples: DNA, RNA
        Functions: Store genetic information, help cells make proteins
    Energy storage in living things
      Carbohydrates: Store energy in plants
      Lipids: Store energy in animals
    Classes containing oxygen
      Carbohydrates: Contains oxygen
      Proteins: Contains oxygen
      Lipids: Contains oxygen
      Nucleic acids: Contains oxygen

      Comparison of bulbs: 25-watt vs 60-watt
      High-power vs low-power devices
    Calculating power
      Example: Microwave doing 24,000 joules in 30 seconds
      Example: Another microwave doing 5,000 joules in 5 seconds
    Calculating work
      Work = Power * Time
      Example: 1000-watt microwave for 20 seconds
    Comparison of power

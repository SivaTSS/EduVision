  Atom Structure
    Atoms
      Definition: Smallest particles of an element
      Properties: Building blocks of matter
      Size: Trillions fit in a period
    Nucleus
      Location: Center of the atom
      Composition: Protons and neutrons
      Mass: Contains most of the atom's mass
    Atomic Particles
      Protons
        Charge: Positive
        Location: Nucleus
        Role: Defines element properties
      Neutrons
        Charge: Neutral
        Location: Nucleus
        Role: Stabilizes nucleus
      Electrons
        Charge: Negative
        Location: Outside nucleus
        Role: Balances charge with protons
    Atomic Number and Mass Number
      Atomic Number: Number of protons
      Mass Number: Protons + Neutrons
    Ions and Isotopes
      Ions
        Definition: Atoms that gain or lose electrons
        Types: Cations (positive), Anions (negative)
      Isotopes
        Definition: Atoms of the same element with different neutrons
        Example: Carbon-12, Carbon-13
    Quarks
      Definition: Particles that make up protons and neutrons
      Types: Six different types identified
      Interaction: Held together by gluons
    Forces in Atoms
      Electric Force: Attraction between protons and electrons
      Strong Force: Holds nucleus together
    Models of Atoms
      Purpose: Represent very small structures
      Historical Context: Evolved over 200 years

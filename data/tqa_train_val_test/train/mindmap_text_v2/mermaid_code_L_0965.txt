  Newtons Law of Gravity
    Equation
      Force of Gravity
      Variables
        G = gravitational constant
        m1 = mass of first object
        m2 = mass of second object
        r = distance between objects
    Universal Gravitation
      Definition
        Force affects all objects with mass
      Importance
        First scientific law for the universe
        Explains motion on Earth and in space
    Factors Affecting Gravity
      Mass
        Greater mass = stronger gravity
      Distance
        Closer objects = stronger gravity
    Examples
      Apple falling from a tree
      Moon orbiting Earth
      Gravity between everyday objects

  Wave Interactions and Interference
    Sound Waves
      Echo
        Definition: Sound waves bounce back from hard objects
        Example: Man shouting at rock wall
    Wave Reflection
      Definition: Waves bounce back from barriers
      Example: Ocean waves reflecting off rocks
    Wave Refraction
      Definition: Waves bend when entering a new medium
      Example: Light bending in water
    Wave Diffraction
      Definition: Waves spread out around obstacles
      Example: Sound waves bending around corners
    Wave Interference
      Definition: Interaction of waves affecting amplitude
      Types
        Constructive Interference
          Definition: Crests overlap, increasing amplitude
        Destructive Interference
          Definition: Crests overlap troughs, decreasing amplitude
    Standing Waves
      Definition: Wave appears to stand still due to interference

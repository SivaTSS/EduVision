  Replacement Reactions
    What is a replacement reaction
      Elements switch places in compounds
      Involves ions
      More reactive elements replace less reactive elements
    Types of Replacement Reactions
      Single Replacement
        One element replaces another in a compound
        General equation: A + BC → B + AC
        Example: 2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2
      Double Replacement
        Two ionic compounds exchange ions
        General equation: AB + CD → AD + CB
        Example: NaCl + AgF → NaF + AgCl
    Comparison of Single and Double Replacement
      Single involves one reactant compound
      Double involves two reactant compounds
    Non-Replacement Reactions
      Identify reactions that are not replacement reactions

  Calculating Acceleration from Force and Mass
    Equation
      a = F / m
      F = m * a
    Concepts
      Acceleration
        Change in motion
        Caused by unbalanced force
      Mass
        Affects acceleration
        Measured with a balance
      Net Force
        Combination of unseen forces
        Calculated from mass and acceleration
    Examples
      Corey's Jump
        Mass = 60 kg
        Net Force = 30 N
        Acceleration = 0.5 m/s²
      Xander's Scooter
        Mass = 50 kg
        Net Force = 25 N
        Acceleration = 0.5 m/s²
      Force Calculation
        F = m * a
        Example: 40 kg at 0.8 m/s² requires 32 N

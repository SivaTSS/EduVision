  acceleration
    definition
      measure of change in velocity
      includes change in speed and direction
      vector quantity
    calculation
      formula: Acceleration = Δv / Δt
      example: cyclist's acceleration
      negative acceleration (deceleration)
    velocity_time_graphs
      represents velocity changes over time
      slope indicates acceleration
        upward slope: positive acceleration
        horizontal line: zero acceleration
        downward slope: negative acceleration
    examples
      roller coaster dynamics
      falling object acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)

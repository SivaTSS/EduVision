  Acids and Bases
    Acids
      Definition
        Ionic compound producing H+ ions in water
      Properties
        Sour taste
        Turns blue litmus paper red
        Conduct electricity
        React with metals
      Detection
        Litmus paper
          Blue turns red in acid
        Indicators
          Red cabbage juice
      Uses
        Manufacturing products
          Sulfuric acid in paper, paint, detergent
    Bases
      Definition
        Ionic compound producing OH- ions in water
      Properties
        Bitter taste
        Turns red litmus paper blue
        Feels slippery
        Conduct electricity
      Detection
        Litmus paper
          Red turns blue in base
        Indicators
          Red cabbage juice
      Uses
        Soaps containing potassium hydroxide
    Strength of Acids and Bases
      Determined by ion concentration
        Strong acids produce more H+ ions
        Strong bases produce more OH- ions
      pH Scale
        Neutral pH of 7
        Acids < 7
        Bases > 7
    Neutralization Reactions
      Reaction of acid and base
        Produces salt and water
      Example
        H+ + OH- → H2O
        Na+ + Cl- → NaCl
    Environmental Impact
      Acid rain and fog
        Lowers pH of water bodies
        Affects aquatic life
      Soil pH importance for plants

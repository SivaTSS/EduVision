  Light and Its Properties
    Light Travels in a Straight Line
      Until it Strikes an Object
      Until it Changes Medium
    Light Behavior
      Reflection
      Refraction
      Absorption
    Speed of Light
      Constant in Empty Space
      Approximately 300 Million m/s
      Slower in Matter
    Refraction
      Bending of Light
      Depends on Type of Matter
      Angle of Incidence
        Perpendicular
        Non-Perpendicular
    Examples of Light Speed in Materials
      Air: 299 million m/s
      Water: 231 million m/s
      Glass: 200 million m/s
      Vegetable Oil: 150 million m/s
      Alcohol: 140 million m/s
      Diamond: 125 million m/s
    Light Travel Time
      Classroom Example

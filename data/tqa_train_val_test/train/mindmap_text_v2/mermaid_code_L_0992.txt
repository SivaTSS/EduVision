  electromagnetic_waves
    speed_of_light
      value: 300 million meters per second
      travel_time_from_sun: 8 minutes
    wavelength
      definition: distance between corresponding points of adjacent waves
      range: longer than a soccer field to shorter than an atom
    frequency
      definition: number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time
      range: thousands to trillions of waves per second
    energy
      relationship: higher frequency = more energy
      low_frequency: little energy, normally harmless
      high_frequency: a lot of energy, potentially harmful
    wave_speed_relationship
      equation: speed = wavelength * frequency
      implications: shorter wavelength = higher frequency
    example_calculation
      given_wavelength: 3 meters
      calculated_frequency: 1.0 x 10^8 Hz
      reverse_calculation: wavelength for 3.0 x 10^8 Hz = 1.0 m

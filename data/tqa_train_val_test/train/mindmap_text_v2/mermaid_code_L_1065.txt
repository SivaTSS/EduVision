  Wave Amplitude
    Definition
      Maximum distance particles move from resting position
    Transverse Waves
      Crest height determines amplitude
      Amplitude = height of crest - resting position
    Longitudinal Waves
      Compression distance determines amplitude
      Amplitude = distance between compressed particles
    Energy Relation
      Greater energy results in greater amplitude
      Example: small pebble vs big boulder in water

  Work and Power
    Definition of Work
      Use of force to move an object
      Calculated as Force x Distance
      SI unit: Joule (J)
    Definition of Power
      Measure of work done in a given time
      Calculated as Work / Time
      SI unit: Watt (W)
    Relationship between Work and Power
      Power = Work / Time
      More powerful devices do more work in less time
    Examples of Work
      Jana lifting a weight
      Pieter passing a book
      Electric mixer doing work
    Everyday vs Physics Definition
      Physics: Force must be in the direction of movement
      Example: Tennis player vs student studying
    Machines and Work
      Examples: Tractors, leaf blowers
      Commonality: Help perform work
    Problem Solving
      Calculating work from force and distance
      Calculating power from work and time

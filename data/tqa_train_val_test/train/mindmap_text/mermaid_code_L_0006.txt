    Definition
      Masses of flowing ice
      Cover 10% of Earth's surface

        Huge, cover large areas
        Examples: Greenland, Antarctica
      Valley Glaciers
        Long and narrow
        Form in mountains
    Formation
      More snow falls than melts
      Layers compact into ice
    Erosion
      Methods
        Plucking
          Rocks picked up and carried
        Abrasion
          Scraping of underlying rock
      Unique Features
        Cirques
          Rounded hollows on mountains
        ArÃªtes
          Jagged ridges between cirques
        Horns
          Sharp peaks from multiple cirques
    Deposition
      Glacial Till
        Mixture of particles and rocks
      Landforms
        Moraine
          Sediment deposited by glaciers
        Drumlins
          Long, low hills in groups
        Eskers
          Winding ridges from meltwater streams
        Kettle Lakes
          Formed from melting ice chunks

      Erosion and deposition shape landscapes
      Erratics
        Large boulders of different rock types

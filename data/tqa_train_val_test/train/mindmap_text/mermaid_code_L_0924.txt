  Inertia
    What is inertia?
      Definition
      Tendency to resist motion change
    How does inertia affect motion?
      Resting objects remain at rest
      Moving objects continue moving
      Example: Car stopping suddenly
    Relationship between inertia and mass
      Greater mass = greater inertia
      Example: Pushing cousins on skateboard
    Real-world application
      Skateboard example
        Josh at Newton's Skate Park
        Gravity's effect
        Why skateboard doesn't tip
      Unbalanced forces
        Overcoming inertia
        Example: Lauren pushing skateboard
      Friction's role
        Opposes motion
        Eventually stops moving objects
      Airborne skateboard
        Force of gravity acting
        Changes motion when in air

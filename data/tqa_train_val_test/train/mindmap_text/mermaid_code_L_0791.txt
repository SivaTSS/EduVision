  Accelerating Due to Gravity
    Why Objects Fall Faster
      Longer Fall Increases Velocity
      Acceleration Rate
        9.8 m/sÂ²
    Rate of Acceleration
      Constant for All Objects
      Independent of Mass
    Effect of Mass
      Mass vs. Acceleration
        Bowling Ball vs. Soccer Ball
        Same Acceleration in Vacuum
      Air Resistance
        Affects Different Objects
        Example: Leaf vs. Acorn

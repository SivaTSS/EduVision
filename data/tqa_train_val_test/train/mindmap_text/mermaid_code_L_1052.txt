  Electric Charge Transfer
    Charge Transfer Methods
      Conduction
        Definition: Direct contact between materials
        Example: Van de Graaff generator
        Everyday Example: Walking on wool carpet
      Polarization
        Definition: Movement of electrons within a neutral object
        Example: Touching a metal doorknob after walking on carpet
      Friction
        Definition: Transfer of electrons due to rubbing
        Example: Rubbing a balloon against hair
    Ions
      Cations
        Definition: Positively charged ions
        Formation: Atoms lose electrons
      Anions
        Definition: Negatively charged ions
        Formation: Atoms gain electrons
    Law of Conservation of Charge
      Definition: Total charge remains constant
      Implication: Electrons move but are not destroyed
    Practical Examples

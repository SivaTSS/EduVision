  Homeostasis
    Definition
      - Ability to maintain stable internal environment
      - Response to changing external environment
    Key Variables
      - Temperature
        - Normal range: ~98.6Â°F
        - Effect on enzymes
      - Fluid balance
        - Concentration of urine
      - Blood glucose levels
        - Insulin and glucagon roles
    Feedback Mechanisms
      - Negative Feedback
        - Definition: Response keeps variable close to set value
        - Example: Body temperature regulation
          - Receptors detect change
          - Brain processes signal
          - Response to decrease temperature
      - Positive Feedback
        - Definition: Response increases likelihood of event
        - Examples: 
          - Milk production in nursing mothers
          - Uterine contractions during childbirth
    Internal Conditions Regulated
      - Temperature
      - Blood flow changes
        - Increased with higher temperature
        - Decreased with lower temperature
      - Hormones
        - ADH: Function in fluid balance
        - Insulin: Lowers blood glucose
        - Glucagon: Raises blood glucose
    Ectotherms vs. Endotherms
      - Ectotherms: Body temperature related to environment
      - Endotherms: Maintain stable internal temperature

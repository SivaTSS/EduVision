  Ozone Depletion
    Ozone in the Stratosphere
      Function
        Absorbs ultraviolet radiation
        Protects Earth from UV rays
    Ozone Molecule
      Structure
        Composed of three oxygen atoms (O3)
      Formation
        Oxygen atoms bond together
    Interaction with Chlorine
      Chlorine's Role
        Breaks apart ozone molecules
        Forms chlorine monoxide (ClO)
      Consequences
        Ozone loss increases UV radiation
        One CFC can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules
    CFCs and Ozone Depletion
      Characteristics
        Human-made chemicals
        Used in various products
      Mechanism
        Float to stratosphere, break apart
        React with ozone, leading to depletion
    Ozone Hole
      Definition
        Area with significantly reduced ozone
      Location
        Primarily over Antarctica
        Smaller effects in Northern Hemisphere
    Consequences of Ozone Loss
      Health Effects
        Increased sunburns and skin cancers
        Cataracts and immune system issues
      Environmental Impact
        Reduced crop yields
        Decreased phytoplankton productivity
    Global Response
      Actions Taken
        CFCs banned in some countries (1978)
        Decline in CFC production since peak in 1986

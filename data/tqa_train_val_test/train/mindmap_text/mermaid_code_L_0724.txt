  Friction
    Definition
      Opposes motion
      Caused by surface roughness
    Types of Friction
      Static Friction
        Acts on resting objects
        Example: Walking on a sidewalk
      Sliding Friction
        Acts on sliding objects
        Example: Sliding furniture
      Rolling Friction
        Acts on rolling objects
        Example: Moving boxes on a dolly
      Fluid Friction
        Acts on objects moving through fluids
        Example: Skydiver with parachute
    Factors Affecting Friction
      Surface texture
        Rough vs. smooth
      Weight of objects
        Heavier objects create more friction
    Effects of Friction
      Produces heat
        Rubbing hands together
        Useful in lighting matches
      Can be beneficial or detrimental
        Increases safety (e.g., sand on ice)
        Causes wear in machinery (e.g., car engines)

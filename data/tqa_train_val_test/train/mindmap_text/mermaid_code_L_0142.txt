  Fossils
    Body Fossils
      Definition: Remains of organisms
      Examples: Bones, shells, teeth
    Trace Fossils
      Definition: Traces left by organisms
      Examples: Burrows, tracks, coprolites
    Conditions for Fossil Formation
      Quick Burial
        Importance: Prevents decay and fragmentation
        Locations: River deltas, ocean floors, mudslides
      Unusual Circumstances
        Examples: La Brea Tar Pits, Burgess Shale, Solnhofen Limestone
    Reasons for Marine Fossil Abundance
      Hard Parts: Shells and bones more likely to fossilize
      Environmental Factors: Marine organisms often buried quickly
    Challenges in Fossilization
      Soft-bodied Organisms: Rarely preserved
      Scavenging: Organisms often consumed before fossilization
    Fossil Record
      Importance: Clue to history of life and past climates
      Composition: Mostly hard parts, few soft-bodied fossils

  Exothermic Reactions
    What is an exothermic reaction?
      Definition: Chemical reaction releasing heat
      Energy dynamics: Less energy to break bonds than released
    Why are products warmer than reactants?
      Energy release: Heat produced during reaction
      General equation: Reactants â†’ Products + Energy
    Example of an exothermic reaction
      Combustion reactions
        Definition: Substance burns with oxygen
        Energy output: Heat and light released
        Real-world example: Hot water heater
    Key concepts
      Energy in reactions: Breaking bonds vs. forming bonds
      Comparison with endothermic reactions
        Definition: More energy needed to break bonds than released

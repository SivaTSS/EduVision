  Compounds
    Definition
      Unique substance
      Formed by chemical combination
      Fixed ratio of elements
    Types of Compounds
      Covalent Compounds
        Definition
          Atoms held by covalent bonds
          Formed between nonmetals
        Example
          Water (H2O)
      Ionic Compounds
        Definition
          Ions held by ionic bonds
          Formed when metals transfer electrons to nonmetals
        Example
          Sodium chloride (NaCl)
    Properties
      Fixed composition
      Differ from constituent elements
      Example: Water vs. Hydrogen and Oxygen
    Comparison with Mixtures
      Mixtures
        Combination of substances in any proportion
        Example: Lemonade
      Differences
        Compounds have fixed ratios; mixtures do not
    Chemical Bonds
      Definition
        Force of attraction between atoms or ions
      Types
        Covalent bonds
        Ionic bonds
    Examples of Compounds
      Water (H2O)
        2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
      Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)
        Different properties from water
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
        Odorless, colorless gas
      Carbon Monoxide (CO)
        Harmful gas, colorless and odorless

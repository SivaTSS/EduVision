  Force
    Definition
      - Push or pull acting on an object
      - Examples: Friction, Gravity, Applied Force
    Characteristics
      - Vector: Size and Direction
      - SI Unit: Newton (N)
        - 1 N = 1 kg * m/sÂ²
    Net Force
      - Combined forces acting on an object
      - Calculation
        - Opposite directions: Subtract
        - Same direction: Add
      - Examples
        - Balanced Forces: Equal forces, net force = 0
        - Unbalanced Forces: Unequal forces, net force > 0
    Relation to Motion
      - Changes in motion due to applied force
      - Force affects speed and direction
    Activities
      - Explore force, mass, and acceleration
      - Problem-solving examples

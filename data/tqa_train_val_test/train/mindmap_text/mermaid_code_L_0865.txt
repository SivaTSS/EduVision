  Einstein's Concept of Gravity
    Newton's Description of Gravity
      Law of Gravity
        Force of attraction
        Strength depends on mass and distance
      Limitations
        Predicts motion of most objects
        Does not explain why gravity occurs
        Not applicable in all cases
    Einstein's Explanation of Gravity
      Theory of General Relativity
        Gravity as warping of space-time
        Mathematical derivation
        Visual analogy: bowling ball on trampoline
      Implications
        Massive bodies curve space-time
        Objects move due to space-time curvature
    Acceptance of Einstein's Theory
      Supported by evidence
      Widely accepted today
      Newton's law still used for calculations

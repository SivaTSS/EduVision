  Acid-Base Neutralization
    Neutralization Reaction
      Definition: Reaction producing water and salt
      Example: HNO3 + KOH → H2O + KNO3
    Acids
      Definition: Produce H+ and nonmetal ions in water
      Example: Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
        Equation: H2O + 2 HCl → H+ + Cl-
    Bases
      Definition: Produce OH- and metal ions in water
      Example: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
        Equation: H2O + 2 NaOH → OH- + Na+
    Products of Neutralization
      Water
      Salt
        Definition: Neutral ionic compound
        Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl)
          Equation: Na+ + Cl- → NaCl
    Additional Example
      Antacid Reaction
        Reactants: CaCO3 + 2 HCl
        Products: H2O + CaCl2 + CO2

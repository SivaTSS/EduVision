  Vision and the Eye
    Eye Structure
      Sclera
        - Opaque outer covering
        - Protects the eye
      Cornea
        - Transparent outer covering
        - Acts as a convex lens
        - Focuses light
      Pupil
        - Opening in the front
        - Controls light entry
      Iris
        - Colored part of the eye
        - Controls pupil size
      Lens
        - Convex lens
        - Fine-tunes focus
        - Controlled by tiny muscles
      Retina
        - Membrane lining the back
        - Contains rods and cones
          - Rods: dim light sensing
          - Cones: color sensing (red, green, blue)
      Optic Nerve
        - Carries signals to the brain
    Vision Process
      Light Gathering
        - Light enters through eye structures
        - Focused on retina
      Signal Conversion
        - Retina converts images to electrical signals
      Brain Interpretation
        - Visual cortex processes signals
        - Interprets shape, color, brightness
        - Corrects image orientation
    Key Concepts
      Vision Definition
        - Ability to see
      Eye and Brain Collaboration
        - Both necessary for vision
      Impact of Lens Shape
        - Concave lens affects focus
        - No signals sent to brain
      Visual Cortex Role
        - Processes visual information
        -

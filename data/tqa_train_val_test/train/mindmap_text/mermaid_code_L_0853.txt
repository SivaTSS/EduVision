  Decomposition Reactions
    Definition
      - Breakdown of one reactant into two or more products
      - General equation: AB → A + B
    Examples
      - Hydrogen Peroxide
        - Decomposition: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2
      - Carbonic Acid
        - Decomposition: H2CO3 → H2O + CO2
      - Water
        - Decomposition: 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2
    Characteristics
      - Opposite of synthesis reactions
      - Products vary based on reactants
    Balanced Equations
      - Missing components in examples
        - 2Ni2O3 → 4Ni + ?
        - 2Al2O3 → ? + 3O2
    General Rules
      - Decomposition of metal hydrogen carbonates

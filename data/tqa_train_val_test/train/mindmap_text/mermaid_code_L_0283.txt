  Radioactive Decay as a Measure of Age
    Radiation
      Definition
      Detection
    Types of Radioactive Decay
      Alpha Decay
        Composition: 2 protons, 2 neutrons
        Effect on Nucleus: Loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons
      Beta Decay
        Composition: 1 electron
        Effect on Nucleus: One neutron decays to form a proton and an electron
    Radioactive Isotopes
      Definition: Unstable isotopes that change by gaining or losing particles
      Parent and Daughter Isotopes
        Parent: Original element
        Daughter: Stable product formed from decay
    Half-Life
      Definition: Time for half of parent isotopes to decay
      Exponential Decay
        Explanation: Rate of decay is constant over time

  Biochemical Reactions
    Photosynthesis
      Definition: Synthesis of glucose from CO2 and H2O using light energy
      Chemical Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2
      Organisms: Plants and certain other organisms
      Energy Conversion: Light energy to chemical energy
    Cellular Respiration
      Definition: Breakdown of glucose with oxygen to produce CO2, H2O, and energy
      Chemical Equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Heat and Chemical Energy
      Energy Release: Releases energy for cellular processes
    Enzymes
      Role: Biochemical catalysts that speed up reactions
      Example: Pepsin (requires acid)
      Importance: Essential for maintaining life by accelerating reactions
    Energy Classification
      Photosynthesis: Endothermic reaction
      Cellular Respiration: Exothermic reaction

  Work Calculation
    Equation
      Work = Force x Distance
      Rearrangement
        Force = Work / Distance
        Distance = Work / Force
    SI Unit
      Joule (J)
      Definition
        1 Joule = 1 N x 1 m
    Examples
      Clarissa and Mom
        Force = 200 N
        Distance = 1.1 m
        Work = 220 J
      Clarissa's Weight
        Work = 528 J
        Distance = Height to truck bed
      Mowing Lawns
        First Lawn
          Force = 100 N
          Distance = 200 m
          Work = 20,000 J
        Second Lawn
          Distance = 234 m
          Work = 23,400 J
      Pushing Mower
        Distance = 30 m
        Work = 2700 J
        Force = 90 N
      Lifting Mower
        Work = 400 J
        Force = 200 N

  Radioactive Decay
    Definition
      Process of unstable nuclei becoming stable
      Emission of particles and energy
    Types of Radioactive Decay
      Alpha Decay
        Emission of alpha particles
        Example: Uranium-238 to Thorium-234
      Beta Decay
        Emission of beta particles (electrons)
        Example: Thorium-234 to Protactinium-234
      Gamma Decay
        Emission of gamma rays
        No change in element
    Half-Life
      Definition
        Time for half of a radioisotope to decay
      Importance
        Measures decay rate
        Varies by isotope
    Radioactive Dating
      Method to estimate ages of fossils and rocks
      Example: Carbon-14 dating
        Formation in atmosphere
        Decay to nitrogen-14
        Fixed ratio in living organisms
        Decline after death
    Applications
      Estimating ages of fossils
      Limitations of Carbon-14 dating
        Effective for fossils < 50,000 years
        Use of longer half-life isotopes for older fossils
    Comparison of Decay Types
      Differences in emission, travel distance, and penetration
      Alpha particles: limited travel, low penetration
      Beta particles: moderate travel, moderate penetration
      Gamma rays: extensive travel, high penetration

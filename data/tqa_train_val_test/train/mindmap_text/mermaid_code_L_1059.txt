  Valence Electrons
    Definition
      Electrons in outer energy level
      Participate in interactions
    Importance
      Determine reactivity
      Influence conductivity
    Electron Dot Diagrams
      Representation of valence electrons
      Structure of diagrams
    Octet Rule
      Definition
      Based on stability
      Achieving an octet
        Gain electrons
        Lose electrons
    Periodic Table
      Valence electrons and position
        Groups 1-2 and 13-18
        Groups 3-12 complexity
      Similar chemical properties in groups
    Reactivity
      Metals vs Nonmetals
        Metals give up electrons
        Nonmetals attract electrons
      Examples of reactive elements
        Sodium and Chlorine
        Calcium and Oxygen
    Conductivity
      Metals as conductors
      Nonmetals as insulators
      Metalloids as semiconductors

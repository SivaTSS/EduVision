  Atom Structure
    Atoms
      Smallest particles of an element
      Building blocks of matter
      Consist of smaller particles
    Nucleus
      Center of the atom
      Contains protons and neutrons
      Most of the atom's mass
    Atomic Particles
      Protons
        Positive charge
        Unique to each element
      Neutrons
        No charge
        Often equal to protons
      Electrons
        Negative charge
        Equal to protons in neutral atoms
    Atomic Number and Mass Number
      Atomic Number
        Number of protons
        Unique for each element
      Mass Number
        Protons plus neutrons
        Approximate mass in amu
    Ions and Isotopes
      Ions
        Positive ions (cations)
        Negative ions (anions)
      Isotopes
        Same element, different neutrons
        Example: Carbon-12, Carbon-13
    Quarks
      Building blocks of protons and neutrons
      Six types identified
      Held together by gluons
    Forces in Atoms
      Electric force
        Attraction between protons and electrons
      Strong force
        Holds nucleus together
        Effective only at short distances

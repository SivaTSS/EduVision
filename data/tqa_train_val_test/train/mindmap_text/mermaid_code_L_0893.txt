  Energy Levels
    Definition
      Fixed distances from nucleus
      Electrons found in these levels
    Structure
      Energy levels as steps
      Electrons occupy specific levels
    Electron Capacity
      Maximum electrons per level
        Level I: 2 electrons
        Level II: 8 electrons
        Level III: 18 electrons
        Level IV: 32 electrons
      Orbitals
        Definition of orbitals
        Types of orbitals (S, P, etc.)
    Valence Electrons
      Definition and significance
      Stability of atoms
        Example: Helium
        Example: Fluorine and Lithium
    Electron Movement
      Jumping between levels
        Absorbing energy
        Releasing energy (light)
    Reactivity
      Influence of valence electrons
      Examples of reactive elements

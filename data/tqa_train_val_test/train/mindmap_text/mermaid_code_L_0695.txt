    What is Touch?
      Definition
      Importance
    Touch Receptors
      Types
        Mechanoreceptors
          Function: Pressure, vibrations, texture
          Location: Fingertips, skin
        Thermoreceptors
          Function: Temperature sensation
          Types: Hot receptors, cold receptors
          Location: Face, ears
        Pain Receptors (Nociceptors)
          Function: Detect pain and damage
          Location: Skin, muscles, bones, blood vessels, organs
        Proprioceptors
          Function: Body position awareness
          Location: Joints, tendons, muscles
    Sensory Neurons
      Location: Skin, internal organs
      Functions: Pain, pressure, temperature detection
    Communication with the Brain
      Pathway of Sensation
        From receptors to central nervous system
        Processing in the brain (e.g., frontal lobe)
      Reflex Arcs
        Definition: Direct response via spinal cord
        Example: Knee-jerk reaction
    Sensitivity of Skin
      Areas with High Sensitivity
        Palms, soles, face, tongue, lips
      Comparison with Other Body Parts
        Internal pain detection (e.g., stomach, joints)

  Calculating Acceleration
    Equation for Acceleration
      Change in Velocity
      Change in Time
    SI Unit for Acceleration
      m/s2
    Average Acceleration
      Example 1
        Cyclist Velocity Change
          From 4 m/s to 7 m/s
          Time Period 5 seconds
          Calculation
      Example 2
        Cyclist Velocity Change
          From 1 m/s to 6 m/s
          Time Period 5 seconds
          Calculation
      Example 3
        Cyclist Slowing Down
          From 6 m/s to 2 m/s
          Time Period 4 seconds
          Calculation

  Gravity
    Definition
      Force of attraction between two masses
      Weight measured in newtons (N)
    Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
      Attraction between all objects
      Strength depends on mass and distance
    Einstein's Theory of Gravity
      Gravity as curvature of space and time
      Objects follow curved paths due to warping
    Effects of Gravity
      Acceleration of falling objects (9.8 m/sÂ²)
      Projectile motion
        Curved path due to horizontal and vertical forces
      Orbital motion
        Moon's orbit around Earth
        Balance of forward velocity and gravitational pull

  Newtons Third Law
    Definition
      Action-Reaction Principle
        Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
        Forces act in pairs
    Momentum
      Definition
        Property of a moving object
        Equals mass times velocity
      Calculation
        Momentum = Mass Ã— Velocity
        Example: Golf ball momentum calculation
      Comparison
        Bowling ball vs. softball
        Effect of mass and velocity on momentum
    Conservation of Momentum
      Definition
        Momentum is conserved in collisions
      Example
        Truck and car collision
        Combined momentum before and after collision
    Applications
      Real-world examples
        Skateboarders pushing apart
        Kangaroo jumping
    Problems
      Example problems
        Calculate momentum of a child running
        Compare momentum of football players

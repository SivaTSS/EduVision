  Hearing and Balance
    Hearing
      Sound Waves
        Travel through air
        Vibrations in ear
      Ear Structure
        Outer Ear
          Pinna
          Ear Canal
        Middle Ear
          Eardrum
          Tiny Bones
            Hammer (Malleus)
            Anvil (Incus)
            Stirrup (Stapes)
        Inner Ear
          Cochlea
          Auditory Nerve
      Process of Hearing
        Sound waves hit eardrum
        Vibrations pass through bones
        Cochlea converts vibrations
        Hair cells release neurotransmitters
        Nerve impulses to brain
      Hearing Loss
        Damage from loud sounds
        Permanent loss of hair cells
    Balance
      Sense of Balance
        Role of Ears
        Kinocilium
      Semicircular Canals
        Liquid movement
        Hair cells send impulses
        Connection to cerebellum
      Maintaining Balance
        Body position sensing
        Muscle response from cerebellum

  Metabolism
    Definition
      - Biochemical reactions in living organisms
      - Sum of all biochemical reactions
    Biochemical Reactions
      - Types
        - Catabolic Reactions
          - Break bonds
          - Release energy (exothermic)
          - Example: Complex carbohydrates to simple sugars
        - Anabolic Reactions
          - Form bonds
          - Absorb energy (endothermic)
          - Example: Simple sugars to complex carbohydrates
    Enzymes
      - Role
        - Increase reaction rate
        - Reduce activation energy
      - Characteristics
        - Synthesized in cells
        - Not changed in reactions
        - Highly specific and efficient
    Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
      - Relationship
        - Provide energy to organisms
      - Photosynthesis
        - Reactants: CO2 and H2O
        - Products: O2 and glucose
      - Cellular Respiration
        - Reactants: O2 and glucose
        - Products: CO2, H2O, and energy

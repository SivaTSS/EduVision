  Radio Waves
    What are Radio Waves?
      Definition
      Characteristics
        Longest wavelengths
        Lowest frequencies
        Least energy
    AM vs FM Radio Broadcasts
      AM (Amplitude Modulation)
        Encoding method
        Longer wavelengths
        Reflection off ionosphere
        Distance coverage
      FM (Frequency Modulation)
        Encoding method
        Shorter wavelengths
        Passes through ionosphere
        Clarity of sound
    Radio Waves in Television Broadcasts
      Encoding methods
        Sounds: Frequency Modulation
        Pictures: Amplitude Modulation
      Transmission process
        Broadcast from TV tower
        Decoding by television sets
    Electromagnetic Spectrum
      Definition
      Range of frequencies
        10^5 to 10^12 Hz
      Comparison with other electromagnetic waves

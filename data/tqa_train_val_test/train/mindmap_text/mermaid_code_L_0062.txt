      Spiral Galaxies
        Features
          Rotating disk of stars and dust
          Central bulge
          Spiral arms
          Young, blue stars
      Elliptical Galaxies
        Features
          Oval shape
          Mostly old stars
          Red to yellow color
          Little gas and dust
      Irregular Galaxies
        Characteristics
          Deformed by other galaxies
          Not spiral or elliptical
    Milky Way Galaxy
      Structure
        Disk
        Central bulge
        Spiral arms
      Location of Earth
        In a spiral arm
        More than halfway from center
      Size and Composition
        About 400 billion stars
        100,000 light-years across
        Possible black hole at center
    Star Clusters
      Open Clusters
        Groups of young stars
        Loosely held by gravity
      Globular Clusters
        Groups of old stars
        Spherical shape
        Tightly held by gravity

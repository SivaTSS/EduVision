  Covalent Bonding
    Definition
      Covalent Bond
        Attraction between atoms
        Sharing of valence electrons
    Characteristics
      Nonmetals only
      Same or different elements
    Covalent Compounds
      Formation
        Atoms of different elements
        Example: Water (H2O)
      Molecule
        Smallest particle of a covalent compound
    Valence Electrons
      Determining number of bonds
        Nitrogen: 3 bonds
        Chlorine: 1 bond
    Strength of Bonds
      Comparison with ionic bonds
        Covalent bonds are stronger
    Conductivity
      Covalent compounds do not conduct electricity
    Diatomic Molecules
      Examples
        Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Halogens

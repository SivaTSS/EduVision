  Electromagnetic Waves
    Properties
      Speed
        Speed of Light
          3.0 x 10^8 m/s
          Fastest in the universe
          Slower in mediums (e.g., water)
      Wavelength
        Definition
          Distance between corresponding points
        Range
          From kilometers to fractions of a millimeter
      Frequency
        Definition
          Number of waves per second
        Range
          From thousands to trillions of waves per second
        Relationship with Energy
          Higher frequency = Greater energy
    Relationships
      Speed, Wavelength, Frequency
        Equation
          Speed = Wavelength x Frequency
        Inverse Relationship
          Shorter wavelength = Higher frequency
          Longer wavelength = Lower frequency
    Effects of Medium
      Refraction
        Bending of light when passing from air to water
        Example: Light slows down in water
    Applications
      Calculating Frequency and Wavelength
        Example Problem
          Given wavelength = 3 m, find frequency
          Frequency = 1.0 x 10^8 Hz

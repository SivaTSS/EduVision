  Energy from Biomass
    Biomass
      Definition
        Material from recently living plants and animals
      Uses
        Direct burning
        Biofuel production
          Crops (e.g., corn, algae)
          Organic materials (e.g., almond shells, food scraps)
    Biofuels
      Advantages
        Cleaner burning than fossil fuels
        Less pollution and carbon dioxide
        Liquid form suitable for gas tanks
      Production
        Biochemical refining
        Thermochemical refining
        Gasification with oxygen
    Algae as Biofuel
      Advantages over other sources
        Requires less land and energy
        Grows in non-arable areas
        Carbon neutral
      Research focus
        Promising alternative to traditional crops
    Challenges
      Inefficiency of some crops (e.g., corn)
        Energy and resources consumed vs. produced
      Environmental impact
        Fertilizer and pesticide runoff
        Pollutants in water bodies
    Biomass Power
      Reliability
        More reliable than other renewable sources
      Waste utilization
        Cow manure for methane
        Food scraps for green energy

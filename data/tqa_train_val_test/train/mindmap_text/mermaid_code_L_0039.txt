  Topographic Maps
    Definition
      Flat maps showing 3D surface features
      Connect points of equal elevation
    Features
      Contour Lines
        Connect equal elevation points
        Indicate slope and terrain shape
      Contour Intervals
        Difference in elevation between lines
        Calculated using bold lines
      V-Shapes
        Indicate stream valleys
        Point uphill
      Circles
        Concentric circles indicate hills
        Hatched circles indicate depressions
    Uses
      Earth Scientists
        Describe surface features
        Determine slope and water flow
      Engineers
        Plan roads, bridges, and tunnels
      Tourists
        Understand landscape for navigation
    Reading Topographic Maps
      Identify landforms
        Hills, valleys, cliffs, and streams
      Calculate distances
        Using horizontal scale
      Interpret contour spacing
        Close lines indicate steep slopes
        Far lines indicate gentle slopes
    Types of Maps
      Bathymetric Maps
        Show underwater features
        Depth below surface
      Geologic Maps
        Display rock units and features
        Show layers and faults

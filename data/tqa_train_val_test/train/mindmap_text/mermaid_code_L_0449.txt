  Aquatic Biomes
    Freshwater Biomes
      Definition: Low salt concentration (<1%)
      Types
        Ponds and Lakes
          Size: Few square meters to thousands of square kilometers
        Streams and Rivers
          Flowing water from headwaters to mouths
        Wetlands
          Types: Marshes, swamps, bogs
    Marine Biomes
      Definition: Higher salt concentration
      Types
        Oceans
          Zones: Photic and aphotic
        Coral Reefs
          Dominant organisms: Corals and algae
        Estuaries
          Definition: Where freshwater meets ocean
          Salinity: Varies due to mixing
    Key Factors
      Sunlight Availability
        Photic Zone: Up to 200 meters, supports photosynthesis
        Aphotic Zone: Deeper than 200 meters, relies on chemosynthesis
      Dissolved Oxygen and Nutrients
        Surface Water: Higher oxygen levels
        Near Shore: More nutrients from land runoff
        Bottom Water: Nutrients from decomposed organisms
    Comparison
      Freshwater vs Marine
        Freshwater: <1% salt, adapted organisms
        Marine: Higher salt, specialized adaptations

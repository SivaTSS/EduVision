  Wavelength
    Definition
      Measurement
        Distance between corresponding points
        Measured in meters
    Types of Waves
      Transverse Waves
        Particle motion
          Up and down
          Perpendicular to wave direction
        Wavelength measurement
          Distance between adjacent crests
      Longitudinal Waves
        Particle motion
          Back and forth
          Same direction as wave
        Wavelength measurement
          Distance between adjacent compressions
    Energy Relation
      Short-wavelength waves
        More energy
      Long-wavelength waves
        Less energy

  Efficiency
    Definition
      Input Work
      Output Work
      Friction
    Importance
      Measure of Performance
      Less than 100 Percent
      Closer to 100 Percent is Better
    Calculation
      Efficiency Formula
        Efficiency = Output Work Input Work 100%
      Example Calculation
        6000 Joules Output
        8000 Joules Input
        Efficiency = 75%
      Rani's Example
        7500 Joules Input
        6700 Joules Output
        Efficiency = 90%
    Machines
      Definition of Work
        Work = Force x Distance
      Role of Machines
        Make Work Easier
        Cannot Increase Total Work
      Types of Machines
        Simple Machines
          Inclined Plane
          Dolly
    Friction
      Definition
        Force Opposing Motion
      Impact on Efficiency
        Work Used to Overcome Friction

    Heliocentric Model
      Definition: Sun-centered model
      Proponent: Nicolaus Copernicus
      Features
        - Simplicity: No epicycles or deferents

    Copernican Revolution
      Definition: Shift from Earth-centered to Sun-centered view
      Significance: Fundamental change in understanding the universe
    Earth's Motion
      Revolution: 365.24 days for one complete orbit
      Rotation: Spinning on its axis
      Perihelion: Closest point to the Sun
      Aphelion: Farthest point from the Sun

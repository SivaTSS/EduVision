  Population Growth
    Limiting Factors
      Definition
        - Environmental elements that lower growth rate
      Examples
        - Low food supply
        - Lack of space
        - Light
        - Water
        - Nutrients
        - Oxygen
        - Disease/Parasites
        - Temperature
        - Predation
        - Weather
        - Human activities (pesticides, habitat destruction)
    Types of Growth
      Exponential Growth
        - Characterized by rapid increase (J-shaped curve)
        - Occurs without limiting factors
      Logistic Growth
        - Characterized by S-curve
        - Occurs with limiting factors
        - Levels off at carrying capacity (K)
    Carrying Capacity
      Definition
        - Maximum population size supported without habitat destruction
      Influences
        - Determined by limiting factors
        - Affects birth and death rates
    Population Dynamics
      Initial Growth
        - High birth rates with ample resources
      Resource Depletion
        - Decrease in resources leads to lower birth rates
        - Population stabilizes at carrying capacity

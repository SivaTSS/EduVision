  Archimedes Law
    Definition
      - Buoyant force
      - Weight of displaced fluid
    Key Concepts
      - Displacement
        - Volume of fluid displaced
        - Volume of submerged object
      - Shape of objects
        - Effect on buoyancy
        - Examples (ship vs. steel ball)
    Historical Context
      - Archimedes' observation
        - Water displacement in a tub
        - Occupying space
    Practical Applications
      - Floating objects
        - Ships
        - Human body in water
      - Experimentation
        - Foil shapes in water
        - Demonstrating buoyancy
    Questions
      - What is Archimedes law?
      - How does shape affect floating?
      - Why does a steel ball sink?

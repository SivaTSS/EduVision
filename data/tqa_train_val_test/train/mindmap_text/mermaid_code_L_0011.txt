  Earth Formation
    Solar Nebula
      Definition: Giant cloud of gas and dust
      Importance: Formed Sun and planets
    Formation Process
      Contraction: Cloud contracted and spun
      Temperature Increase: Extreme heat led to nuclear fusion
      Planet Formation: Collisions created rocks, boulders, and planets
    Early Earth Conditions
      Hostile Environment: Bombarded by asteroids, volcanic activity
      Lack of Atmosphere: Too hot for liquid water or stable gases
    Earth's Layers
      Density Variation: Core, mantle, crust
      Composition: Iron core, rocky mantle, lighter crust
    Moon Formation
      Collision Theory: Mars-sized asteroid impact
      Result: Material formed the Moon
    Early Atmosphere
      Composition: Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water vapor
      Sources: Volcanic gases and cometary ices
    Changes Over Time
      Cooling: Allowed water vapor to condense
      Ocean Formation: Rain collected to form oceans
      Life Development: Conditions for first life forms

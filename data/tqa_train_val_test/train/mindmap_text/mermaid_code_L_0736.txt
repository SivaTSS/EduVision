  Energy Types
    Definition
      Ability to do work
      Measured in joules (J)
    Kinetic Energy
      Definition
        Energy of moving matter
      Calculation
        KE = 1/2 mass * velocity^2
      Examples
        Hammer pounding a nail
        Moving objects (e.g., people, vehicles)
    Potential Energy
      Definition
        Stored energy due to position or shape
      Types
        Gravitational Potential Energy
          Depends on weight and height
          Calculation: GPE = weight * height
          Examples
            Leaves on trees
            Diver on a diving board
        Elastic Potential Energy
          Result of stretching or compressing
          Examples
            Rubber bands
            Springs
    Energy Conversion
      Definition
        Change from one type of energy to another
      Examples
        Diver's potential energy to kinetic energy
        Swings and trampolines
    Conservation of Energy
      Energy is conserved during conversions
      Some energy lost as heat due to friction

  Light and Matter
    Interaction with Light
      Reflection
        Regular Reflection
          - Forms clear images
          - Example: Smooth surfaces (mirrors)
        Diffuse Reflection
          - No clear image
          - Example: Rough surfaces (rippling water)
      Transmission
        Straight Transmission
        Refraction
          - Change in direction and speed
          - Example: Straw in water
        Scattering
          - Light spreads in all directions
          - Example: Light in fog or smoky air
      Absorption
        Energy Transfer
          - Increases temperature of matter
          - Example: Dark surfaces in sunlight
    Classification of Matter
      Transparent
        - Transmits light without scattering
        - Examples: Air, clear glass
      Translucent
        - Transmits but scatters light
        - Example: Frosted glass
      Opaque
        - Does not transmit light
        - Absorbs or reflects light
        - Examples: Wood, mirrors

  Hot Springs and Geysers
    What Creates a Hot Spring?
      Magma heats groundwater
      Water rises through cracks
      Temperatures can reach hundreds of degrees Celsius
    Why Do Geysers Erupt?
      Water is trapped and superheated
      Pressure builds until it breaks the seal
      Narrow passageways create ideal conditions
    Locations of Hot Springs and Geysers
      Not always found with active volcanism
      Source of heat can vary
      Notable locations
        Yellowstone National Park
        Hot Creek, California
    Characteristics of Hot Springs
      Bubbling water at the surface
      Generally cooler than geysers
    Characteristics of Geysers
      Eruptive behavior
      Conditions for formation
      Approximately 1,000 geysers worldwide
      Half located in the United States

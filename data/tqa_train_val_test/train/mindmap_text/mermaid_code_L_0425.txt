  Cellular Respiration
    Definition
      Process of breaking down glucose
      Produces ATP
      Takes place in cytoplasm and mitochondria
    Stages
      Glycolysis
        Location: Cytoplasm
        Anaerobic process
        Produces 2 ATP
        Splits glucose into pyruvate
      Krebs Cycle
        Location: Mitochondrial matrix
        Aerobic process
        Produces 2 ATP
        Combines oxygen with carbon from pyruvate
      Electron Transport
        Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane
        Aerobic process
        Produces up to 34 ATP
        Combines oxygen with hydrogen
    Relationship with Photosynthesis
      Interconnected processes
      Energy storage and release
    Fermentation
      Types
        Lactic Acid Fermentation
          Occurs in bacteria and muscle cells
          Produces lactic acid and ATP
        Alcoholic Fermentation
          Occurs in yeast
          Produces alcohol, carbon dioxide, and ATP
    Advantages
      Aerobic Respiration
        More energy produced
        More ATP molecules formed
      Anaerobic Respiration
        Faster process
        Allows survival in low oxygen environments

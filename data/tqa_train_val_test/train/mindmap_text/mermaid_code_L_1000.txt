    Definitions
      What is a Radioisotope?
        Example: Carbon-14
      Unstable Nuclei
        Reasons for Instability
          Too Many Protons
          Unstable Proton-to-Neutron Ratio
    Isotopes
      Definition
        Same Protons, Different Neutrons
      Radioactive Isotopes
        Characteristics
          Constant Decay
          Emission of Radiation
    Stability
      Proton-to-Neutron Ratios
        Small Protons: 1:1
        Large Protons: 1:1.5
    Carbon Example
      Carbon-12
        Stable Nucleus
        Proton-to-Neutron Ratio: 1:1
      Carbon-14
        Unstable Nucleus
        Proton-to-Neutron Ratio: 1:1.3

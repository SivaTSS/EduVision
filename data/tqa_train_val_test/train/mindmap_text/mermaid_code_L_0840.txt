  Compound Machine
    Definition
      - Consists of multiple simple machines
      - Examples: wheelbarrow, corkscrew, bicycles, cars
    Simple Machines in Wheelbarrow
      - Lever
        - Applies upward force to load
        - Increases force for easier lifting
      - Wheel and Axle
        - Pushed over ground
        - Increases force for easier pushing
    Example: Scissors
      - Consists of simple machines
      - Labeling of components
    Efficiency vs. Mechanical Advantage
      - Lower efficiency due to friction
        - Friction opposes motion
        - More moving parts = more friction
        - Lubricants reduce friction
      - Greater mechanical advantage
        - Product of mechanical advantages of components

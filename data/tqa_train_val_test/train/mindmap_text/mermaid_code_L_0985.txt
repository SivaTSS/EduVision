  Position-Time Graphs
    Making a Position-Time Graph
    Slope of a Line Graph
      Definition of Slope
      Slope Representation
        Represents Velocity
        Steeper Slope = Faster Motion
    Negative Slope
      Can it Slope Downward?
      Explanation
    Average Velocity
      Calculation
        Change in Position / Change in Time
      Example from Graph 1
        Distance Traveled in 5 Seconds
    Graph Analysis
      Graph 1
        Position vs. Time
        Distance Traveled
      Graph 2
        Velocity Representation
        Horizontal Line = Zero Velocity

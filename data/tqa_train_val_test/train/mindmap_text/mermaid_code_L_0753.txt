  Electromagnetic Spectrum
    Definition
      Full range of wavelengths and frequencies
      Continuous change of wavelength, frequency, and energy
    Radio Waves
      Longest wavelengths, lowest frequencies
      Uses
        Radio and television broadcasts
        Microwave ovens
        Cell phone transmissions
        Radar
    Light
      Mid-wavelength electromagnetic waves
      Forms of Light
        Visible Light
          Narrow range of wavelengths
          Colors of light (red to violet)
          Appears white when combined
        Infrared Light
          Longer wavelengths than visible light
          Felt as heat
          Sources: Sun, fires, living things
        Ultraviolet Light
          Shorter wavelengths than visible light
          Higher energy, can kill bacteria
          Effects on skin
            Sunburn and skin cancer
            Protection tips
              Wear protective clothing
              Use sunscreen (SPF)
    X Rays
      Shortest wavelengths, highest frequencies
      Uses
        Medical imaging
        Dental X rays
        Airport luggage screening
      Risks
        Potential cancer risk from exposure
    Gamma Rays
      Most energetic electromagnetic waves
      Uses
        Cancer treatment
        Research applications
    Sound Encoding
      AM and FM radio waves
        AM: Amplitude modulation
        FM: Frequency modulation
    Radar

  Replacement Reactions
    What is a Replacement Reaction?
      Definition: Elements switch places in compounds
      Involves: Ions and ionic compounds
      Reactivity: More reactive elements replace less reactive ones
    Types of Replacement Reactions
      Single Replacement Reactions
        Definition: One element replaces another in a single compound
        General Equation: A + BC → B + AC
        Example: 2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2
      Double Replacement Reactions
        Definition: Two ionic compounds exchange ions
        General Equation: AB + CD → AD + CB
        Example: NaCl + AgF → NaF + AgCl
    Comparison of Single and Double Replacement Reactions
      Single Replacement
        Involves: One reactant compound
      Double Replacement
        Involves: Two reactant compounds
    Non-Replacement Reactions
      Examples: 
        a. Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu
        b. 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2
        c. Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2
        d. 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl

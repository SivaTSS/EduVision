  Geological Stresses
    Definition
      Stress
        Force applied to an object
        Force per unit area on rock
    Types of Stress
      Confining Stress
        Weight of overlying material
      Compression
        Squeezes rocks together
        Common at convergent boundaries
      Tension
        Pulls rocks apart
        Common at divergent boundaries
      Shear
        Parallel forces in opposite directions
        Common at transform boundaries
    Deformation
      Strain
        Change in shape due to stress
      Types of Deformation
        Elastic
          Returns to original shape
        Plastic
          Does not return to original shape
        Fracture
          Breaks under stress
    Factors Affecting Response
      Rock type
      Temperature
      Pressure conditions
      Duration of stress
      Type of stress
    Geological Context

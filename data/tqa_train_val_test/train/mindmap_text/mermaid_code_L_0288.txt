  Rock Types
    Definition
      Naturally formed
      Non-living Earth material
    Composition
      Made of minerals
        Mixture of different minerals
        Single mineral type (e.g., quartzite)
      Non-mineral rocks
        Example: Coal (organic material)
    Classification
      Identified by minerals
      Identified by texture
        Size of mineral grains
        Shape of mineral grains
        Arrangement of mineral grains
    Importance of Texture
      Reflects rock formation history
      Distinctive for each rock type
      Example: Diorite vs. Andesite
        Different cooling rates
        Visible vs. microscopic grains

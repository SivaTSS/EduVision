  Synthesis Reactions
    Overview
      Definition: Two or more reactants combine to form a single product
      General Equation: A + B → AB
    Examples
      Sodium and Chlorine
        Reaction: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl
        Product: Sodium Chloride (Table Salt)
      Nitrogen and Oxygen
        Reaction: 2NO + O2 → 2NO2
    Identification
      Characteristics
        Easy to identify due to single product formation

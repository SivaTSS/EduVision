  Enzymes as Catalysts
    Definition
      - Proteins that speed up biochemical reactions
      - Necessary for life
    Function
      - Reduce activation energy
      - Increase reaction rate
      - Not changed in reactions
    Models of Enzyme Action
      - Lock-and-Key Model
        - Substrates fit into active site
      - Induced Fit Theory
        - Enzyme changes shape to fit substrate
    Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
      - Temperature
      - pH
    Importance in Digestion
      - Over 1000 enzymes needed
      - Examples: Amylase, Pepsin
    Biochemical Reactions
      - Occur constantly in cells
      - Enzymes prevent slow reactions

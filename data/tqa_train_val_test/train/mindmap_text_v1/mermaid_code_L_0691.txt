  Carbon Cycle
    Types of Carbon
      Organic Carbon
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
        Example: Glucose (C6H12O6)
    Biological Processes
      Photosynthesis
        Converts CO2 to Glucose
        Chemical Equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
      Cellular Respiration
        Releases CO2 into Atmosphere
        Reverse of Photosynthesis
    Human Impact
      Burning Fossil Fuels
        Increases CO2 in Atmosphere
        Contributes to Global Warming
      Other Activities
        Disruption of Carbon Cycle
    Carbon Cycle Components
      Carbon Exchange
        Between Living Organisms and Atmosphere
      Decomposition
        Releases Carbon Back to Atmosphere
      Combustion
        Organic Matter and Fossil Fuels
    Greenhouse Gases
      Definition
        Traps Heat in Atmosphere
      Effects
        Global Temperature Rise
        Climate Change

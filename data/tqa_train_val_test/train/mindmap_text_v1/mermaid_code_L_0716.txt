    Strength of Acids and Bases
      Determined by ion concentration
        Strong acids produce more H+ ions
        Strong bases produce more OH- ions
      pH Scale
        Neutral: pH 7
        Acidic: pH < 7
        Basic: pH > 7
    Neutralization Reactions
      Definition
        Reaction between acid and base
      Products
        Water and salt
          Example: H+ + OH- → H2O
          Example: Na+ + Cl- → NaCl
      Importance
        Neutral pH of products

  Scientific Models
    Definition
      Representation of complex systems
      Easier manipulation than real systems
      Used for predictions
    Types of Models
      Physical Models
        Smaller, simpler representations
        Examples: globe, map
      Conceptual Models
        Ties together ideas to explain phenomena
      Mathematical Models
        Sets of equations
        Usually implemented on computers
    Importance in Science
      Tools for understanding complex systems
      Help analyze and predict behaviors
      Example: CO2 levels and plant growth
    Validation of Models
      Testing against past data
      Accurate predictions of the present increase future accuracy
    Limitations
      Simplicity compared to real systems
      May not predict real behavior accurately
      Accuracy depends on computing power and model construction

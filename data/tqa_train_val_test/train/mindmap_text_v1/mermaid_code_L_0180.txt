  Glaciers
    Types of Glaciers
      Continental Glaciers
        - Large ice sheets
        - Flow outward from accumulation
      Alpine Glaciers
        - Form in high mountains
        - Travel through valleys
      Ice Caps
        - Cover larger areas than valleys
        - Can encompass entire mountain ranges
    Glacier Formation
      - Zone of Accumulation
        - More snow falls than melts
      - Zone of Ablation
        - More melting than accumulation
      - Equilibrium Line
        - Separates accumulation and ablation zones
      - Conversion Process
        - Snow to firn to glacial ice
    Glacier Movement
      - Factors Influencing Movement
        - Ice amount, slope steepness, ground roughness
      - Movement Mechanisms
        - Plastic flow under pressure
        - Sliding on lubricated base
      - Speed Variability
        - Ranges from fast to nearly zero
    Glacier Features
      - Crevasses
        - Cracks from movement
      - Bergshrund
        - Large crevasse at glacier top
    Environmental Impact
      - Water Resource
        - Provides water in summer for organisms and humans
      - Melting Trends
        - Global melting and shrinking glaciers
        - Example: Glacier National Park
    Challenges
      - Protection of Glaciers
        - Issues in Yosemite National Park

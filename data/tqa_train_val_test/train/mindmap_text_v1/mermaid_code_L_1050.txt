  Thermal Radiation
    Definition
      Transfer of thermal energy
      Waves travel through air/space
    Mechanism
      Thermal energy from fire to hands
      Thermal energy from sun to Earth
    Characteristics
      All objects radiate thermal energy
      Thermal energy = total kinetic energy of particles
    Methods of Transfer
      Thermal radiation
      Conduction
      Convection
    Examples
      Bonfire
        Transfers energy to hands
      Heated home
        Radiates energy outdoors
        Insulation effects
      People
        Radiate thermal energy
    Detection
      Special cameras
        Visual representation of radiated heat
        Areas of high thermal energy

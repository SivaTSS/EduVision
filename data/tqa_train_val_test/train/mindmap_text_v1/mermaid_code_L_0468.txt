  Human Circulation
    Blood Vessels
      Types
        Arteries
          Function: Carry blood away from the heart
          Structure: Thick walls, elastic
        Veins
          Function: Return blood to the heart
          Structure: Thinner walls, valves
        Capillaries
          Function: Exchange of gases and substances
          Structure: Thin walls
      Endothelium
        Definition: Inner lining of blood vessels
        Present in: Arteries, veins, capillaries
      Circulation Types
        Systemic Circulation
          Function: Carries oxygen-rich blood to the body
          Pathway: Left ventricle → Aorta → Body → Vena Cava → Right atrium
        Pulmonary Circulation
          Function: Carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs
          Pathway: Right ventricle → Pulmonary arteries → Lungs → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium
      Key Components
        Aorta
          Description: Largest artery, carries oxygen-rich blood
        Vena Cava
          Description: Collects deoxygenated blood from the body
        Pulmonary Arteries
          Description: Only arteries carrying oxygen-poor blood
        Pulmonary Veins
          Description: Only veins carrying oxygen-rich blood

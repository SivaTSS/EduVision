  Kinetic Theory of Matter
    Motion of Particles
      Ice
        Least kinetic energy
        Particles vibrate in place
      Liquid Water
        Moderate kinetic energy
        Particles slide past each other
      Water Vapor
        Most kinetic energy
        Particles spread apart
    Kinetic Theory Principles
      Constant motion of particles
      Kinetic energy definition
        Energy of motion
      Relationship to state of matter
        Solids
          Fixed volume and shape
          Particles closely packed
        Liquids
          Fixed volume, changing shape
          Particles can slide
        Gases
          No fixed volume or shape
          Particles can spread out
    Energy and Matter
      Energy as ability to cause change
      Kinetic energy in moving matter
      Example: Lifting an arm
    Demonstration with Cola
      Shaking bottle
        Carbon dioxide changes to gas
        Gas particles spread out
      Pouring cola
        Liquid particles slide over each other
      Solid glass remains unchanged

  Hydrocarbons
    Definition
      - Compounds of carbon and hydrogen
      - Simplest carbon-based compounds
    Types
      Saturated Hydrocarbons
        - Single bonds (Alkanes)
        - Examples: Methane, Ethane, Propane
        - Shapes: Straight-chain, Branched-chain, Cyclic
        - Isomers
      Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
        - At least one double or triple bond
        - Alkenes (double bonds)
          - Example: Ethene
        - Alkynes (triple bonds)
          - Example: Ethyne (Acetylene)
        - Aromatic Hydrocarbons
          - Ring structure with alternating bonds
          - Example: Benzene
    Properties
      - Influence of size on boiling/melting points
      - Nonpolar nature
      - Solubility in water
    Uses
      - Fuels: Gasoline, Natural gas, Diesel, etc.
      - Manufacturing: Plastics, Synthetic fabrics
    Sources
      - Fossil Fuels: Coal, Petroleum, Natural gas
      - Formation from dead organisms

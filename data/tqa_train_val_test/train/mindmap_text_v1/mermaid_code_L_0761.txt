    Magnets
      Definition
        Attracts materials like iron
        Has north and south poles
      Properties
        Magnetic force
          Attraction and repulsion
        Magnetic field
          Surrounds the magnet
          Visualized with iron filings
    Types of Materials
      Ferromagnetic

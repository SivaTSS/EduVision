    What is an Ionic Bond?
      Definition
      Formation
        Metallic Elements
        Nonmetallic Elements
    Electron Transfer
      Metals
        Lose Electrons
        Become Positive Ions
      Nonmetals
        Gain Electrons
        Become Negative Ions
    Energy Considerations
      Energy to Remove Electrons
        Valence Electrons
        Group Trends
      Energy Released When Gaining Electrons
    Example: Sodium and Chlorine
      Sodium (Na)
        Becomes Na+
        Charge +1
      Chlorine (Cl)
        Becomes Cl-
        Charge -1
      Ionic Compound
        Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
        Common Name: Table Salt

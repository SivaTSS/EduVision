  Gamma Decay
    Gamma Rays
      Definition: Electromagnetic waves
      Characteristics
        - Most energetic electromagnetic waves
        - Carry photons of energy (gamma particles)
      Production
        - Occurs during gamma decay of excited nucleus
    Gamma Decay Process
      Emission
        - Nucleus emits gamma particle (energy packet)
      Comparison with Other Decays
        - Only energy emitted (unlike alpha/beta decay)
        - No change in number of protons
    Reasons for Gamma Decay
      Stability
        - Occurs when nucleus is in excited state
        - Happens after alpha or beta decay
      Radioactive Elements
        - Unstable nuclei undergo decay to become stable
        - Types of decay: alpha, beta, gamma
    Dangers of Gamma Rays
      Penetration
        - Travel farther than alpha/beta particles
        - Require lead or concrete for shielding
      Biological Impact
        - Can damage cells deep inside the body

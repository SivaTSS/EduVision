      Object at rest remains at rest
      Object in motion remains in motion
      Acted on by unbalanced force
    Application in Skateboarding
      Starting Motion
        Need to push off with foot
        Overcoming friction
      Stopping Motion
        Friction as unbalanced force
        Skateboard stops without push
      Changing Direction
        Pressing down on one side
        Creates unbalanced force
    Historical Context
      Developed by Isaac Newton
      Part of three laws of motion
      Known as the law of inertia
    Real-life Examples

  Newton's First Law of Motion
    Definition
      - An object's motion will not change unless an unbalanced force acts
      - At rest: stays at rest
      - In motion: stays in motion with constant velocity
    Inertia
      - Definition: Tendency to resist change in motion
      - Relationship to mass
        - Greater mass = Greater inertia
        - Example: Pushing a full box vs. an empty box
    Unbalanced Force
      - Necessary to change an object's motion
      - Causes acceleration
      - Example: Kicking a soccer ball
    Real-World Applications
      - Skateboard and curb scenario
      - Amusement park ride dynamics
      - Pool balls on a table
    Importance of Seat Belts
      - Inertia in car accidents
      - Body's forward motion when a car stops suddenly

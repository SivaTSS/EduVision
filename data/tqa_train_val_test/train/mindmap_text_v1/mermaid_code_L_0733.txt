    Functions of Machines
      Increase Force
        Examples: Doorknobs, Nutcrackers
      Increase Distance
        Examples: Paddles, Hammers
      Change Direction
        Examples: Claw Hammers, Pulleys
    Key Concepts
      Efficiency
        Definition: Measure of work reduction
        Calculation: Output work divided by Input work
      Mechanical Advantage
        Definition: Multiplication of input force
        Actual Mechanical Advantage: Output force divided by Input force
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage: Input distance divided by Output distance
    Examples
      Efficiency Calculation
        Example: 8000 joules input, 6000 joules output
        Result: 75% efficiency
      Mechanical Advantage Calculation
        Example: Ramp with input distance of 6m and output distance of 2m
        Result: Ideal Mechanical Advantage of 3

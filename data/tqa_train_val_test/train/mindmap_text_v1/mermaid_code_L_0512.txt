  Phenotype and Genotype
    Definition
      Phenotype: Traits or characteristics
      Genotype: Genetic makeup
    Natural Selection
      Acts on Phenotype
        Distinction between AA and Aa
        Homozygous vs Heterozygous
      Does not act on Genotype
        Environment cannot distinguish
    Harmful Genes
      Dominant Harmful Genes
        Impact on population
      Recessive Harmful Genes
        Example: Tay-Sachs disease
          Carriers: Heterozygous individuals
          Maintained in gene pool
      Gene Pool
        Complete set of genes and alleles
        Importance of carriers
    Lethal Recessive Genes
      Persistence in Gene Pool
        Carriers do not express phenotype
        Mating of heterozygous individuals

        Input Distance: 1 m
        Output Distance: 0.2 m
        Weight of Rock: ?
        Mechanical Advantage: ?
    Machine Mechanics
      Definition
        Mechanical Advantage of a Machine
      Calculations
        Actual Mechanical Advantage
          Formula: Output Force / Input Force
          Factors: Overcoming Friction
        Ideal Mechanical Advantage
          Formula: Input Distance / Output Distance
          Difference from Actual
            Always Greater Due to Friction
    Practical Applications
      Measuring Forces
        Difficulty in Measuring Input/Output Forces
        Easier to Measure Distances
      Inclined Plane Example
        Ramp Characteristics
          Input Distance: 6 m
          Output Distance: 2 m
          Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 3
        Another Ramp Example
          Input Distance: 8 m
          Output Distance: 4 m
          Ideal Mechanical Advantage: 2
    Machine Types
      Force and Distance Relationships
        Strength of Force
          Increases
          Decreases
          Stays the Same
        Distance Over Force
          Decreases
          Increases
          Stays the Same
        Examples
          Ramp: >1
          Hammer: <1
          Flagpole: =1
          Pulley: =1

  Surface Wave
    Definition
      Description: A wave that travels along the surface of a medium
      Examples: Ocean waves
    Particle Movement
      Circular Motion: Up and down, back and forth
      Medium: Matter through which the wave travels
    Causes of Ocean Waves
      Wind: Most ocean waves caused by wind blowing across water
      Energy Transfer: Air molecules transfer energy to water molecules
      Wave Size: Stronger winds create larger waves
    Types of Waves
      Transverse Wave: Particles move up and down perpendicular to wave direction
      Longitudinal Wave: Particles move parallel to wave direction
      Surface Wave: Combination of transverse and longitudinal waves
    Behavior in Shallow Water
      Dragging Effect: Waves drag on the bottom, slowing down
      Steepening: Difference in speed causes waves to steepen
      Breaking Waves: Waves topple over and create surf

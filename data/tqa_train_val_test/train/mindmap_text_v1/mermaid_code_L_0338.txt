  Fossilization Types
    Mold Fossils
      Definition: Depression left in the shape of the material
      Formation: Original material dissolves
    Cast Fossils
      Definition: Rocky material that fills the mold
      Formation: Sediments fill the mold space
    Trace Fossils
      Definition: Indications of organism activity (e.g., footprints)
    True Form Fossils
      Definition: Actual remains of the organism
    Main Kinds of Fossils
      Permineralization
        Definition: Minerals replace organic material
        Process: Mineral-rich water infuses sediment
        Examples: Dinosaur bones, petrified wood
      Compression
        Definition: High pressure leaves dark imprints
        Common Organisms: Leaves, ferns
    Preservation of Soft Parts
      Rarity: Few fossils preserve soft parts
      Exceptions: Insects in amber, animals in ice
    Fossilization Processes
      Five Main Processes
        1. Unaltered Preservation
        2. Permineralization
        3. Mold and Cast Formation
        4. Compression
        5. Pyritization

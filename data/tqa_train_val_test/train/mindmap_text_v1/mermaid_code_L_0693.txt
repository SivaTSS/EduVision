  Water Cycle
    Definition
      Continuous process
      Movement of water
    Key Processes
      Evaporation
        Water from oceans
        Leaves salts behind
      Condensation
        Water vapor to droplets
        Forms clouds
      Precipitation
        Rain, snow, hail
        Returns water to Earth
      Surface Runoff
        Water flows over surface
        Collects in streams and rivers
      Infiltration
        Water enters the ground
        Becomes groundwater
      Groundwater Storage
        Stored in aquifers
      Surface Water Storage
        Lakes, rivers, reservoirs
      Evapotranspiration
        Water vapor from plants
        Process of transpiration
    Comparison with Nutrient Cycles
      Water vs. Nutrients
        Water is recycled
        Nutrients are recycled
      Biogeochemical Cycles
        Involves biotic and abiotic components
        Water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle
    Importance of Water
      Essential for life
      High water content in organisms
      Supports ecosystems
    Biological Productivity
      Role in photosynthesis
      Increased in heavy precipitation areas

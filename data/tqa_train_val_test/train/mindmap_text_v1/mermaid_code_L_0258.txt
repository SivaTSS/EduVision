  Ocean Zones
    Vertical Zones
      Photic Zone
        Definition: Light penetrates to about 200m
        Importance: Supports photosynthetic organisms (phytoplankton)
      Aphotic Zone
        Definition: No light for photosynthesis
        Characteristics: 
          - Majority of ocean
          - Low diversity and numbers of life
        Challenges for Life
          - Absence of light
          - Low temperature
          - High pressure
    Horizontal Zones
      Intertidal Zone (Littoral Zone)
        Characteristics: 
          - Between high and low tidal marks
          - Constant change due to waves and tides
      Neritic Zone
        Characteristics: 
          - From low tide mark to continental shelf edge
          - Some sunlight reaches seabed
          - High productivity and nutrient levels
      Oceanic Zone
        Definition: Rest of the ocean beyond neritic zone
        Characteristics: 
          - No sunlight reaches the bottom
    Nutrient Sources
      Deep Ocean
        Sources of Nutrients: 
          - Organic matter from surface
          - Hydrothermal vents
    Comparisons
      Intertidal vs Neritic vs Oceanic Zones
        Similarities and Differences
    Productivity
      Reasons for High Productivity
        Neritic Zone: Highest density of life and nutrients
        Epipelagic Zone: Most productivity due to sunlight

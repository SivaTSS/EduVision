  Chemical Bonds
    Definition
      Chemical Bond
        - Force of attraction between atoms
        - Involves sharing or transferring electrons
      Chemical Compound
        - New substance formed from chemical bonds
        - Fixed ratio of elements
    Properties of Compounds
      General Properties
        - Consist of fixed ratios
        - Different compounds have different properties
    Types of Bonds
      Ionic Bonds
      Covalent Bonds
      Metallic Bonds
    Examples of Compounds
      Water (H2O)
        - 2 Hydrogen atoms
        - 1 Oxygen atom
      Hydrogen Chloride (HCl)
        - 1 Hydrogen atom
        - 1 Chlorine atom
      Methane (CH4)
        - 1 Carbon atom
        - 4 Hydrogen atoms
      Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)
        - 2 Hydrogen atoms
        - 2 Oxygen atoms
      Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
        - 1 Carbon atom
        - 2 Oxygen atoms
      Carbon Monoxide (CO)
        - 1 Carbon atom
        - 1 Oxygen atom
    Importance of Ratios
      Different ratios lead to different compounds
      Example: Water vs. Hydrogen Peroxide

  Wave Frequency
    What is wave frequency?
      Definition: Number of waves passing a fixed point in a given time
    SI Unit
      Hertz (Hz)
      1 Hz = 1 wave/second
    Frequency Calculation
      Example: 10 waves in 5 seconds = 2 Hz
    Relationship to Energy
      Higher frequency = more energy
      Same amplitude comparison
    Measurement
      Counting crests in a time period
    Wavelength
      Definition: Distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves
      Relationship: Higher frequency = shorter wavelength
    Vibration Frequency
      Frequency of wave = frequency of vibrations causing the wave
      Higher frequency requires more energy

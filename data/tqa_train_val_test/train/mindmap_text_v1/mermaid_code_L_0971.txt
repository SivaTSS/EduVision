  Nuclear Fusion
    Definition
      Process of combining small nuclei
      Results in larger nucleus and energy release
    Natural Occurrence
      Happens in the sun and stars
      Requires extremely high temperatures
        Overcomes repulsion between nuclei
    Energy Release
      Form of energy released
      Reaches Earth from the sun
    Controlled Fusion
      Scientists' goals
        Develop fusion power plants
        Convert fusion energy to electricity
      Challenges
        Achieving high temperatures
        Containing plasma
    Advantages
      Harmless elements (hydrogen and helium)
      Abundant hydrogen in ocean water
      Potential for vast energy supply
    Disadvantages
      Current technology limitations
      Difficulty in achieving necessary conditions

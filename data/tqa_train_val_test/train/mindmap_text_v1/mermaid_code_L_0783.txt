  Chemical Equations
    Definition
      Symbolic representation of chemical reactions
      Example: C + O2 → CO2
    Writing Chemical Equations
      Use of chemical symbols and formulas
      General form: Reactants → Products
      Example: H2 + O2 → H2O
    Balancing Chemical Equations
      Importance of balancing
        Law of conservation of mass
        Matter cannot be created or destroyed
      Coefficients
        Definition: Numbers in front of symbols/formulas
        Example: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
      Steps to Balance
        Count atoms in reactants and products
        Add coefficients to balance
        Repeat until balanced
      Common Problems
        Example: N2 + H2 → NH3
        Example: CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O
    Types of Chemical Reactions
      Synthesis reactions
      Other types of reactions
    Historical Context
      Antoine Lavoisier's experiments

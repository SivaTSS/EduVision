  Scientific Graphing
    Advantages of Graphs
      Visual representation of data
      Easier interpretation than tables
    Types of Graphs
      Bar Graphs
        Comparison of values
        Example: Average tornadoes in cities
        Axes representation
          X-axis: Cities
          Y-axis: Average tornadoes
      Circle Graphs
        Shows percents of a whole
        Example: Tornado strength distribution
        Limitations: Only for percents
      Line Graphs
        Shows changes over time
        Example: Monthly tornado averages
        Trend analysis
          Peaks and declines throughout the year
    Data Tables

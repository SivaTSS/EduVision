  Water Pollution
    Definition
      Water pollution occurs when chemicals, sewage, trash, or heat enter water resources
      Threatens supply of clean, fresh water
    Causes
      Fertilizer Runoff
        Leads to algal blooms
        Causes dead zones
      Point-Source Pollution
        Examples: factory waste, sewage treatment plants
      Nonpoint-Source Pollution
        Example: runoff from fields and lawns
      Thermal Pollution
        Caused by heated water discharge
    Effects
      Algal Blooms
        Excessive growth of algae
        Outcompetes other organisms
      Dead Zones
        Hypoxic water cannot support life
        Example: Gulf of Mexico dead zone
    Solutions
      Reducing Fertilizer Use
      Preserving Wetlands
        Slow down and filter runoff
        Provide habitats for species
    Ocean Pollution
      Trash
        Mainly plastics from various sources
        Dangerous to aquatic life
      Ocean Acidification
        Increased CO2 levels lead to more acidic water
        Harms corals and shellfish
        Interferes with marine food webs

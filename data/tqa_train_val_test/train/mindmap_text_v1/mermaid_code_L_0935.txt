  Momentum Conservation
    Law of Conservation of Momentum
      Definition
        Total momentum is conserved
        Momentum transferred during collisions
    Vehicle Collision
      Missing Velocity (x)
        Diagram analysis
        Momentum conservation in collisions
    Skater Collision
      Skater 1 and Skater 2
        Skater 2 has more momentum initially
        Momentum transfer during collision
        Skater 1 gains momentum
        Skater 2 loses momentum
      Head-on Collision
        Momentum conservation applies
        Combined momentum remains the same

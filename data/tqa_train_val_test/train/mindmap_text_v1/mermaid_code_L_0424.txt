  Photosynthesis
    Definition
      Process of making glucose using light energy
      Requires water and carbon dioxide
      Produces oxygen as a byproduct
    Photosynthetic Organisms
      Plants
      Algae
      Some bacteria
    Chloroplast Structure
      Surrounded by two membranes
      Contains thylakoids
        Stacks of membranes
        Contains chlorophyll
      Stroma
        Fluid-filled space
    Stages of Photosynthesis
      Light Reactions
        Occur in thylakoids
        Capture light energy
        Produce ATP and NADPH
        Use water, produce oxygen
      Calvin Cycle
        Occurs in stroma
        Uses ATP and NADPH
        Converts carbon dioxide to glucose
    Energy Flow
      Begins with photosynthesis
      Glucose as energy source
      Cells utilize glucose for energy
    Autotrophs vs Heterotrophs
      Autotrophs
        Self-feeders (e.g., plants)
      Heterotrophs
        Other feeders (e.g., animals)
    Raw Materials for Photosynthesis
      Light
      Water
      Carbon dioxide
      Absorbed through leaves and stomata

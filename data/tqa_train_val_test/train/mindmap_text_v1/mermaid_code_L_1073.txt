      Doorknob
        Force applied to wheel
    Force Application
      Input Force
        Applied to wheel or axle
      Output Force
        Greater than or less than input force
    Mechanical Advantage
      Definition
        Ratio of output force to input force
      Scenarios
        Input force on axle
          Mechanical advantage < 1
          Wheel turns faster
        Input force on wheel
          Mechanical advantage > 1
          Axle turns with greater force

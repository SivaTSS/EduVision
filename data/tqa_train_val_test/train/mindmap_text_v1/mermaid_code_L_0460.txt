    First Line of Defense
      Physical Barriers
        Skin
          Largest organ
          Multi-layered structure
        Mucous Membranes
          Location: mouth, nose, lungs, stomach
          Function: release mucus
      Chemical Barriers
        Body Fluids
          Mucus
            Sticky substance
            Traps pathogens
          Tears
            Contain lysozymes
          Sweat
            Contains enzymes
          Saliva
            Contains lysozymes
        Stomach Acid
          Hydrochloric acid
          Kills pathogens in food/water
        Urine
          Acidic environment
          Inhibits pathogen growth
    Additional Defenses
      Cilia
        Tiny projections in lungs
        Sweep mucus and pathogens out

  Accelerating Objects
    Equation for Acceleration
      Formula: a = F/m
      Rearranged: F = m*a
    Example: Corey on Skateboard
      Mass: 60 kg
      Net Force: 30 N
      Acceleration Calculation
    Example: Xander on Scooter
      Mass: 50 kg
      Net Force: 25 N
      Acceleration Calculation
    Newton's Second Law
      Definition: a = F/m
      Impact of Mass on Acceleration
        Greater Mass = Less Acceleration
        Smaller Mass = Greater Acceleration
    Units of Measurement
      Force: Newton (N)
      Acceleration: m/s²
      Force Definition: 1 kg*m/s²
    Measuring Forces
      Mass Measurement
      Acceleration Calculation
      Challenges in Measuring Net Force
    Example Calculation
      Xander's Acceleration: 0.8 m/s²
      Force Calculation: F = m*a
      Alternative Mass Scenario: 40 kg

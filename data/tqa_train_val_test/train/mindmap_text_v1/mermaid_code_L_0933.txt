      Definition
      Examples
    Factors Affecting Kinetic Energy
      Mass
      Velocity
      Volume
      Distance
      Acceleration
    Calculation of Kinetic Energy
      Formula: KE = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2
      Impact of Mass and Velocity
        Doubling Mass
        Doubling Velocity
    Examples
      Bowling Ball Scenario
        Mass: 7 kg
        Velocity: 4 m/s
        Calculation
      Juan's Scenario
        Mass: 40 kg
        Velocity: 1 m/s
        Calculation
        Increased Velocity to 2 m/s
      Dad's Scenario
        Mass: 80 kg
        Velocity: 1 m/s
        Calculation

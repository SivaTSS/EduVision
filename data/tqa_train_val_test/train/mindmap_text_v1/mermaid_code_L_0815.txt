  Buoyancy
    Buoyant Force
      Definition: Upward force exerted by fluids
      Occurrence: Greater pressure below than above
      Effects: 
        - Object floats if weight < buoyant force
        - Object sinks if weight > buoyant force
    Weight vs. Buoyant Force
      Definition: Weight is the force of gravity
      Comparison: 
        - Equal forces: Object floats
        - Greater weight: Object sinks
    Density
      Definition: Mass per unit volume
      Relation to Buoyancy: 
        - Denser substances are heavier
        - Example: Ice vs. water
    Examples of Buoyancy
      Floating Objects: 
        - Icebergs
        - Oil on water
        - Helium balloons

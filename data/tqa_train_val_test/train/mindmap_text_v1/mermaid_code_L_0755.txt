  Optics
    Definition
      Study of visible light
      Extends human vision
    Reflection
      Law of Reflection
        Angle of incidence = angle of reflection
      Types of Reflection
        Regular Reflection
          Sharp and clear images
        Diffuse Reflection
          Blurry images
    Mirrors
      Types
        Plane Mirrors
          Form virtual, life-sized images
        Concave Mirrors
          Form real or enlarged virtual images
        Convex Mirrors
          Form reduced virtual images
      Applications
        Used in telescopes, headlights, etc.
    Refraction
      Definition
        Bending of light when passing through different media
      Lenses
        Types
          Concave Lenses
            Form reduced virtual images
          Convex Lenses

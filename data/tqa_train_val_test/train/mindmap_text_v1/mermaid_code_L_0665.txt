  RNA
    Types of RNA
      mRNA
        Function
          Carries instructions from nucleus to cytoplasm
        Location
          Produced in the nucleus
      tRNA
        Function
          Brings amino acids to ribosome
        Location
          Cytoplasm
      rRNA
        Function
          Part of ribosome structure
        Location
          Ribosome
    Comparison of RNA and DNA
      Composition
        Different sugars
          Ribose in RNA
          Deoxyribose in DNA
        Base differences
          Uracil in RNA replaces thymine in DNA
      Structure
        RNA is single-stranded
        DNA is double-stranded
    Role of RNA in Protein Synthesis
      mRNA
        Messenger from DNA to ribosome
      tRNA
        Transfers amino acids
      rRNA
        Forms ribosome
    Ribosome Structure
      Site of protein synthesis
      Composed of rRNA and proteins

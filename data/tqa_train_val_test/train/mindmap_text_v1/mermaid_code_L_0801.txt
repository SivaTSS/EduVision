  Artificial Light
    Types of Light Bulbs
      Incandescent
        - Produces light by incandescence
        - Uses heat to generate light
        - Less energy efficient
      Fluorescent
        - Produces light by fluorescence
        - Contains mercury gas
        - Coated with phosphor
      Neon
        - Produces light by electroluminescence
        - Contains neon or other gases
        - Different gases produce different colors
      Vapor
        - Produces light by electroluminescence
        - Contains sodium or mercury
        - Used for streetlights, highways, stadiums
      LED
        - Stands for light-emitting diode
        - Uses semiconductor material
        - Reliable and durable

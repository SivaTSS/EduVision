  Activation Energy
    Definition
      - Energy required to start a chemical reaction
    Importance
      - Needed for reactants to overcome repulsion
      - Allows breaking of bonds
    Types of Reactions
      Exothermic
        - Releases energy
        - Requires activation energy to start
        - Example: Combustion of gasoline
      Endothermic
        - Absorbs energy
        - Requires constant input of energy
        - Example: Energy absorption process
    Activation Energy in Reactions
      - Necessary for all chemical reactions
      - Example: Starting a car engine
      - Comparison of energy changes in reactions
    Visual Representation
      - Diagrams of energy absorption and dissipation
      - Graphs showing activation energy in reactions

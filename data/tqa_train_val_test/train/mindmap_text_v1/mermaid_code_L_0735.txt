    Definition
      - Consists of two or more simple machines
    Examples
      - Bicycles
      - Cars
      - Scissors
      - Fishing rods with reels
    Efficiency
      - Generally lower than simple machines
      - More moving parts lead to more friction
      - Lubricants used to reduce friction
    Mechanical Advantage
      - Greater than simple machines
      - Calculated as the product of the mechanical advantages of component simple machines
    Simple Machines in Compound Machines
      - Bicycles: wheels, axles, pulleys, levers
      - Scissors: two levers, two wedges
      - Fishing Rod: third-class lever, wheel and axle

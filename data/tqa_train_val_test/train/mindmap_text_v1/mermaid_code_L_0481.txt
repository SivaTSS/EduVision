  Cellular Respiration
    Definition
      - Process of converting food energy into usable energy
      - Involves glucose and oxygen
      - Produces carbon dioxide and water
    Purpose
      - Provides energy for cellular functions
      - Supports muscle movement and other activities
    ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
      - Chemical energy used by cells
      - Energy storage and release
        - Stored in phosphate bonds
        - Released when converted to ADP
    Energy Extraction
      - 36 to 38 ATP molecules produced per glucose molecule
    Food Energy
      - Breakdown of food into glucose
      - Glucose as energy source
      - Role of photosynthesis in glucose production
    Plant Respiration
      - Yes, plant cells respire
      - Use of glucose produced during photosynthesis

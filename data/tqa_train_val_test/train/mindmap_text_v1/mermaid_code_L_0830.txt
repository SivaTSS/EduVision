    Writing Chemical Equations
      Example: Calcium Carbonate Reaction
        CaCO3 → CaO + CO2
      Example: Iron Rusting
        Fe + O2 → Fe2O3
    Describing Chemical Reactions
      Example: 2NO2 → 2O2 + N2
    Balancing Chemical Equations
      Definition of Balanced Equation
      Law of Conservation of Mass
      Example: Carbon and Oxygen Reaction
        C + O2 → CO2
      Example: Rusting Reaction
        4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3

  Speed and Velocity
    Speed
      Definition
        Measure of how fast or slow something moves
      Calculation
        Average speed = distance / time
        Example: 120 miles in 3 hours = 40 mi/h
      Instantaneous Speed
        Varies at different moments
        Harder to calculate than average speed
    Velocity
      Definition
        Measure of speed and direction
        Vector representation
      Differences from Speed
        Velocity includes direction
        Speed is scalar
    Distance-Time Graphs
      Representation of Motion
        Shows distance from starting point over time
      Slope Interpretation
        Steepness indicates speed
        Horizontal line indicates zero speed
      Example Calculation
        Speed = change in distance / change in time
    Applications
      Real-life Examples
        Car trips, bike rides
      Importance of Understanding
        Helps in measuring and predicting motion
    Problems and Exercises
      Average Speed Calculation
        Example: Sam's race, Terri's bike trip
      Distance Calculation
        Example: Maria's running distance

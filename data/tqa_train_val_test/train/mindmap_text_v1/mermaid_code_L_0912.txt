  Halogens
    What are halogens?
      Definition
      Group 17 elements
        Fluorine (F)
        Chlorine (Cl)
        Bromine (Br)
        Iodine (I)
        Astatine (At)
    Why are halogens very reactive?
      Seven valence electrons
      Eager to gain one electron
      Reactivity trends
        Decreases from top to bottom
      Reactions with alkali metals

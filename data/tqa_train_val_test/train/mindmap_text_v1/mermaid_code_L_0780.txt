  Covalent Bonds
    Definition
      - Atoms share electrons
      - Covalent compounds
    Formation
      - Attraction between shared electrons and nuclei
      - Nonmetals only
      - Same or different elements
    Types of Covalent Bonds
      - Polar Covalent Bonds
        - Unequal sharing of electrons
        - Slightly negative and positive charges
        - Example: Water (H2O)
      - Nonpolar Covalent Bonds
        - Equal sharing of electrons
        - Neutral charge
        - Example: Oxygen (O2)
    Properties of Covalent Compounds
      - Low melting and boiling points
      - Poor conductors of electricity
      - Individual molecules vs. crystals
      - Solubility in water
    Polar vs Nonpolar Compounds
      - Polar compounds have polar bonds
      - Arrangement affects polarity
      - Example: Formaldehyde vs Carbon Dioxide
    Hydrogen Bonds
      - Attraction between polar molecules
      - Example: Water molecules
      - Affects melting and boiling points
    Naming Covalent Compounds
      - Element order based on periodic table
      - Suffix "ide" for second element
      - Use of prefixes (di-, tri-)

  Atmosphere Layers
    Earthâ€™s Atmosphere
      Major Layers
        Troposphere
          Properties
            - Lowest layer
            - Temperature decreases with altitude
            - Contains 75% of atmospheric gas
            - Weather occurs here
          Temperature Changes
            - Heat from the Sun and Earth's surface
            - Convection cells
            - Temperature inversion
        Stratosphere
          Properties
            - Above troposphere
            - Temperature increases with altitude
            - Contains ozone layer
          Ozone Layer
            - Absorbs UV radiation
            - Protects Earth's surface
        Mesosphere
          Properties
            - Above stratosphere
            - Temperature decreases with altitude
            - Meteors burn up here
        Thermosphere
          Properties
            - Above mesosphere
            - Temperature increases with altitude
            - Contains charged particles (ions)
            - Northern and Southern lights occur here
        Exosphere
          Properties
            - Highest layer
            - Gas molecules far apart
            - Merges with outer space
            - Weak gravity allows molecules to escape
    Temperature Changes
      Altitude Effects
        - Decreases in troposphere and mesosphere
        - Increases in stratosphere and thermosphere
    Energy from the Sun
      Effects on Atmosphere
        - Causes winds in troposphere
        - Influences temperature changes

  Mendeleev and the Periodic Table
    History
      1700s: Early attempts to organize elements
      1860s: Mendeleev's successful method
    Mendeleev's Periodic Table
      Organization
        By atomic mass
        Predicting unknown elements
      Structure
        Rows: Periods
        Columns: Groups (Families)
        Repeating pattern: Periodicity
      Predictions
        Missing elements
        Example: Gallium
    Modern Periodic Table
      Organization
        By atomic number
        Unique atomic number for each element
      Structure
        Rows: Periods
        Columns: Groups (18 groups)
        Change from metals to nonmetals
      Additional Information
        Chemical symbols
        Classes of elements: Metals, Metalloids, Nonmetals

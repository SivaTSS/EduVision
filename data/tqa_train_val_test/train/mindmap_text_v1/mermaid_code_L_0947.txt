  Mechanical Wave
    Definition
      Disturbance in matter
      Transfers energy through matter
    Medium
      Definition
        Matter through which wave travels
      Types of matter
        Solid
        Liquid
        Gas
    Types of Mechanical Waves
      Transverse Waves
        Particles vibrate up and down
        Perpendicular to wave direction
      Longitudinal Waves
        Particles vibrate back and forth
        Parallel to wave direction
      Surface Waves
        Combination of transverse and longitudinal
        Particles move in circular motion
    Energy Source
      Disturbance needed to start wave
      Example: Falling droplets in water
    Particle Movement
      Vibrate in place
      Energy passed to adjacent particles

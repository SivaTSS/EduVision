  Distance Between Stars
    Parallax
      Definition: Apparent shift in position
      Range: Effective for a few hundred light years
      Example: Observing a finger with alternating eyes
      Measurement Process
        Step 1: Observe star from one position
        Step 2: Wait six months for Earth's orbit shift
        Step 3: Observe star again and note position change
        Calculation: Distance based on parallax angle
    Measuring Distant Stars
      Limitations of Parallax
        Too small for distances over a few hundred light years
      Alternative Methods
        Brightness Comparison
          Similarity to Sun's brightness
          Observed vs. Expected brightness

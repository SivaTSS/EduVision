  Friction
    Definition
      Opposes motion
      Occurs between touching surfaces
    Factors Affecting Friction
      Surface roughness
        Rougher surfaces = more friction
        Smoother surfaces = less friction
      Weight of objects
        Heavier objects = greater friction
    Effects of Friction
      Produces heat
        Molecules move faster
        Warms hands when rubbed
      Can be beneficial
        Increases grip (e.g., sand on ice)
      Can be problematic
        Causes wear in machinery
        Overheating in engines
    Reducing Friction
      Use of lubricants (e.g., oil in engines)
      Making surfaces smoother

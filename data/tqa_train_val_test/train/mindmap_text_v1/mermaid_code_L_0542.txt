  Heart
    Chambers
      Atria
        Right Atrium
          Receives oxygen-poor blood
        Left Atrium
          Receives oxygen-rich blood
      Ventricles
        Right Ventricle
          Pumps oxygen-poor blood to lungs
        Left Ventricle
          Pumps oxygen-rich blood to body
    Blood Flow
      Direction
        Atria to Ventricles
        Ventricles to Body
      Loops
        Right Side Loop
          Collects oxygen-poor blood
          Pumps to lungs
        Left Side Loop
          Collects oxygen-rich blood
          Pumps to body
    Valves
      Atrioventricular Valves
        Tricuspid Valve
          Between right atrium and right ventricle
        Mitral Valve
          Between left atrium and left ventricle
      Semilunar Valves
        Pulmonary Valve
          Between right ventricle and pulmonary artery
        Aortic Valve
          Between left ventricle and aorta
    Function
      Circulatory System
        Transports oxygen and nutrients
        Removes waste products
      Heart's Role
        Pumps blood
        Maintains blood flow direction

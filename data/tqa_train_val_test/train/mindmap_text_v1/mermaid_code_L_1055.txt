      Example: Hiking on a trail
      Importance: Prevents slipping
    Sliding Friction
      Definition: Acts on sliding objects
      Comparison: Weaker than static friction
      Example: Writing with a pencil
      Application: Bike brakes
    Rolling Friction
      Definition: Acts on rolling objects
      Comparison: Weaker than sliding and static friction
      Uses: Transportation (bicycles, cars)
      Example: Ball bearings
    Fluid Friction
      Definition: Acts on objects moving through fluids
      Definition of Fluid: Substances that flow (liquids and gases)

  Chemical Bonding
    Ionic Bond
      Definition: Electrons transferred between atoms
      Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
      Sodium: Valence Electrons: 1
      Chlorine: Valence Electrons: 7
      Ion Charges: 
        Sodium Ion: +1
        Chlorine Ion: -1
      Formation: Atoms bond due to charge attraction
    Covalent Bond
      Definition: Atoms share one or more electrons
      Example: Methane (CH4)
      Strength: Strong bonds, require energy to break
      Organic Compounds: Common in biological structures
      Oxygen: Valence Electrons: 6
      Bonding: Oxygen and Hydrogen
    Hydrogen Bond
      Definition: Weak bond between polar molecules
      Example: Water
      Polarity: Water has a positive and negative side
      Importance: Good solvent due to polarity
    Comparison
      Covalent vs Ionic: Sharing vs Transferring electrons
      Strength: Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds
    Water Molecule
      Structure: Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom
      Polarity: Oxygen side negative, hydrogen side positive

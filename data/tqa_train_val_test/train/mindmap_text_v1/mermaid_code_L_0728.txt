  Newton's Second Law
    Definition
      - Acceleration = Net Force / Mass
    Key Concepts
      - Acceleration
        - Change in velocity
        - Caused by unbalanced forces
      - Weight
        - Force of gravity on an object
        - Weight = Mass × Gravity (9.8 m/s²)
    Relationships
      - Force and Acceleration
        - Direct relationship
        - Doubling force doubles acceleration
      - Mass and Acceleration
        - Inverse relationship
        - Doubling mass halves acceleration
    Applications
      - Example Problems
        - Force applied to bookcase
        - Weight calculation for individuals
      - Real-world examples
        - Car acceleration via gas pedal
        - Stopping a skateboard vs. go-cart
    Problem Solving
      - Calculating weight from mass
      - Using F = m × 9.8 m/s²
      - Example: Daisy's weight calculation

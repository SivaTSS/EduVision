  Thermal Conductors and Insulators
    Thermal Conductors
      Definition
        Good conductors of thermal energy
      Examples
        Metals
        Metal radiator
      Properties
        Freely moving electrons
        Faster conduction in solids and liquids
    Thermal Insulators
      Definition
        Poor conductors of thermal energy
      Examples
        Gases (e.g., air)
        Materials (e.g., plastic, wood)
        Down-filled snowsuits
        Insulation in homes
      Properties
        Particles are far apart
        Less frequent particle collisions
    Thermal Conduction
      Definition
        Transfer of thermal energy between touching particles
      Process
        Warmer particles bump into cooler particles
        Energy transfer occurs
      Speed of Conduction
        Faster in solids and liquids than gases
    Practical Applications
      Thermal Conductors
        Heating elements (e.g., toasters)
        Radiators
      Thermal Insulators
        Clothing for warmth
        Food and drink containers (e.g., Styrofoam coolers, thermos)

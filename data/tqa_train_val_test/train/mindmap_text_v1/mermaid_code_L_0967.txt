  Newtons Third Law of Motion
    Definition
      Statement: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
      Forces: Act in pairs
    Action and Reaction
      Examples
        Astronauts in Video
          Action: Astronaut pushes off
          Reaction: Movement in opposite direction
          Effect of Battery Pack: Affects motion
        Newton's Cradle
          Description: Demonstrates action and reaction
        Space Vehicles
          Application: Action and reaction forces for blast off
    Forces Representation
      Arrows
        Direction: Indicates force direction
        Size: Represents force strength
      Skateboard Example
        Action: Jerod pushes against ground
        Reaction: Jerod moves forward
    Force Dynamics
      Non-Balanced Forces
        Explanation: Action-reaction forces act on different objects
        Comparison: Balanced forces cancel out, action-reaction do not
      Daily Life Examples
        Leaning on Objects: Applying force to wall/locker
        Reaction: Wall/locker applies equal and opposite force

  Chemical Reactions
    Types of Reactions
      Synthesis
        Definition: Two or more reactants combine to form a single product
        General Equation: A + B -> C
        Examples
          Sodium and Chlorine: 2Na + Cl2 -> 2NaCl
          Nitric Oxide and Oxygen: 2NO + O2 -> 2NO2
      Decomposition
        Definition: One reactant breaks down into two or more products
        General Equation: AB -> A + B
        Examples
          Carbonic Acid: H2CO3 -> H2O + CO2
          Water: 2H2O -> 2H2 + O2
      Replacement
        Single Replacement
          Definition: One ion takes the place of another in a single compound
          General Equation: A + BC -> B + AC
          Example: 2K + 2H2O -> 2KOH + H2
        Double Replacement
          Definition: Two compounds exchange ions
          General Equation: AB + CD -> AD + CB
          Example: NaCl + AgF -> NaF + AgCl
      Combustion
        Definition: A substance reacts quickly with oxygen
        General Equation: Fuel + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
        Examples
          Methane: CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2

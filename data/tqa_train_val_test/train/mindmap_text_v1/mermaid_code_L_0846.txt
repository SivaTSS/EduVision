  Chemical Reactions
    Definition
      Change of substances
      Represented by chemical equations
    Importance of Balancing
      Law of Conservation of Mass
        Matter cannot be created or destroyed
        Same mass in reactants and products
      Balanced Equations
        Same number of each type of atom
        Example: Burning of Methane
          CH4 + 2O2 â†’ CO2 + 2H2O
          Balanced: 1 C, 4 H, 4 O on both sides
    Historical Context
      Antoine Lavoisier
        Experiments in the 1700s
        Sealed jar method
          Captured gases for accurate measurement
        Conclusion: Mass is conserved
    Evidence of Conservation
      Mass measurements before and after reactions
      Importance of sealing the jar
        Prevents gas escape
        Ensures accurate mass comparison

  Electromagnetic Waves
    Speed of Light
      Definition: 300 million m/s
      Travel Time: 8 minutes from Sun to Earth
      Comparison: Fastest in the universe
    Wavelength and Frequency
      Relationship: Inversely proportional
      Wavelength Range: Longer than soccer field to shorter than atom
      Frequency Range: Thousands to trillions of waves/second
    Energy of Waves
      Dependence: Related to frequency
      Low-Frequency Waves: Little energy, generally harmless
      High-Frequency Waves: High energy, potentially harmful
    Calculating Wavelength and Frequency
      Formula: Speed = Wavelength x Frequency
      Rearranged Equations:
        Frequency = Speed / Wavelength
        Wavelength = Speed / Frequency
      Example Calculation: 
        Given Wavelength: 3 m
        Frequency Calculation: 1.0 x 10^8 Hz

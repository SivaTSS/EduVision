  Velocity
    What is velocity?
      Definition
      Measure of speed and direction
    Difference from speed
      Speed vs. velocity
      Velocity as a vector
    Representation of velocity
      Use of arrows
        Length indicates speed
        Direction indicates motion
    Examples
      Car traveling north at 50 mi/h
      Car traveling east at 25 mi/h
      Average velocity calculation
        Car traveling northwest for 2 hours, 90 miles
    Average velocity calculation
      Formula: velocity = distance / time
      SI unit: m/s + direction
    Key concepts
      Same velocity conditions
        Same speed and direction
      Different velocities
        Different speeds
        Different directions
    Sample problem
      Dog's velocity example
        36 meters in 18 seconds
        Result: 2 m/s east
      Opposite direction example
        36 meters in 24 seconds
        Result: 1.5 m/s west

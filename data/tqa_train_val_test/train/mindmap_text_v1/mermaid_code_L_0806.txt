  Balancing Chemical Equations
    Chemical Equations
      Definition
        Represents changes in chemical reactions
        General form: Reactants → Products
      Importance of Balancing
        Same number of each type of atom on both sides
        Mass conservation in reactions
    Coefficients
      Definition
        Number placed in front of chemical symbols/formulas
        Indicates number of atoms/molecules involved
      Examples
        2 H2 for two molecules of hydrogen
        2 H2 O for two molecules of water
    Steps to Balance Equations
      Step 1
        Count each type of atom in reactants and products
        Check for balance
      Step 2
        Place coefficients as needed
        Use smallest coefficients possible
        Warning: Do not change subscripts
      Step 3
        Repeat steps until balanced
    Example Problems
      Problem 1
        Balance: CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O
      Problem 2
        Sam's mistake: 2 HO → H2 + O2
        Correct way: 2 H2O → H2 + O2
      Problem 3
        Balance: N2 + H2 → NH3
        Solution: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3

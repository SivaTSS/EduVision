    Recombinant DNA Technology
      Definition
        Combination of DNA from different sources
        Useful in gene cloning and protein production
      Applications
        Gene Cloning
          Making exact copies of genes
          Uses in medicine and agriculture
        Protein Production
          Example: Insulin production
            Human gene inserted into bacterial DNA
            Bacteria as factories for insulin
      Process of Gene Cloning
        Steps
          1. Insert gene into vector (recombinant DNA molecule)
          2. Place vector into host cell (bacterium)
          3. Clone gene inside bacterium
          4. Produce protein from cloned DNA
      Plasmids
        Definition
          Small rings of DNA in bacteria
          Not part of bacterial chromosome
        Role in Recombinant DNA
          Used as vectors for foreign DNA
          Contain antibiotic resistance segments
          Origin of replication for DNA copying
      Historical Context
        Cohen and Boyer
          First recombinant DNA creation
          Techniques for bacteria to uptake plasmids
          Isolation of bacteria with desired genes

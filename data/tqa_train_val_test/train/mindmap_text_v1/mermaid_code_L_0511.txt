  Enzymes in the Digestive System
    Enzymes
      Definition
        - Proteins that speed up chemical reactions
      Role in Digestion
        - Break down large food molecules
        - Example: Amylase
    Digestive Enzymes
      Types
        - Amylase
          - Secreted in the mouth
          - Breaks down starch into sugars
        - Proteases
          - Digest proteins
          - Examples: Pepsin, Trypsin
        - Lipases
          - Break down fats
          - Example: Pancreatic lipase
        - Nucleases
          - Digest nucleic acids
          - Examples: Deoxyribonuclease, Ribonuclease
      Bile
        - Produced in the liver
        - Stored in the gallbladder
        - Breaks down fats
    Hormones in Digestion
      Definition
        - Chemical messengers
      Role
        - Regulate digestive processes
      Examples
        - Gastrin: Secretion of gastric acid
        - Cholecystokinin: Secretion of pancreatic enzymes
        - Secretin: Secretion of water and bicarbonate
        - Ghrelin: Signals hunger
        - Gastric inhibitory polypeptide: Decreases gastric secretion

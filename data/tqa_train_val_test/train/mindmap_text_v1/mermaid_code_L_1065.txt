  Wave Amplitude
    Definition
      Maximum distance from resting position
      Relation to wave types
        Transverse waves
          Crest height
          Amplitude measurement
        Longitudinal waves
          Compression distance
          Amplitude measurement
    Examples
      Transverse wave in Figure 1.2
        Crest height: 3 cm
      Longitudinal waves in Figure 1.3
        Comparison of amplitudes
    Energy Relation
      Amplitude and energy correlation
        Higher energy = greater amplitude
        Example: pebble vs. boulder in water

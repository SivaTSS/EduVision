  Wave Speed
    Definition
      Distance traveled in time
      Measured in meters per second
    Equation
      Speed = Wavelength x Frequency
      Rearranged forms
        Frequency = Speed / Wavelength
        Wavelength = Speed / Frequency
    Components
      Wavelength
        Distance between corresponding points
        Measured in meters
      Frequency
        Number of waves per second
        Measured in hertz (Hz)
    Calculations
      Example 1
        Wavelength: 3 m
        Frequency: 1 Hz
        Speed: 3 m/s
      Example 2
        Wavelength: 0.1 m
        Frequency: 2 Hz
        Speed: 0.2 m/s
      Example 3
        Speed: 2 m/s
        Wavelength: 1 m
        Frequency: 2 Hz
    Medium Effects
      Speed varies by medium
        Fastest in solids
        Slowest in gases
      Particle proximity affects speed

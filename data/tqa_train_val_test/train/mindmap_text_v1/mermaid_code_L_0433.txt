  Evolution Evidence
    Fossils
      Definition
        Preserved remains or traces of organisms
      Formation
        Minerals in water turn remains to stone
        Quick sediment coverage increases fossilization chances
      Dating Methods
        Absolute Dating
          Determines age in years (e.g., carbon-14)
        Relative Dating
          Compares ages based on rock layer positions
    Living Organisms
      Body Part Comparisons
        Similar structures indicate common ancestry
      Vestigial Structures
        Non-functional body parts (e.g., human appendix)
      Embryonic Similarities
        Early-stage embryos of different species show similarities
      Molecular Comparisons
        DNA and protein similarities indicate relationships
        Molecular clocks track evolutionary changes
    Recent Evolution
      Darwin's Finches
        Documented by Peter and Rosemary Grant
        Natural selection observed during drought
        Increase in average beak size due to survival of larger beaks
    Whale Evolution
      Fossil evidence of transition from land mammals to aquatic life
      Ancient land mammals adapted to life in water

  Acceleration
    Definition
      Measure of change in velocity
      Includes speed and direction
      Vector quantity
    Calculation
      Formula: Acceleration = Δv / Δt
      Example: Cyclist's acceleration
      Negative acceleration (deceleration)
    Velocity-Time Graphs
      Representation of velocity changes over time
      Slope indicates acceleration
        Positive acceleration
        Zero acceleration
        Negative acceleration
      Example: Sprinter's velocity-time graph
    Real-World Examples
      Roller coaster dynamics
      Falling objects (gravity: 9.8 m/s²)
      Everyday experiences (car acceleration)

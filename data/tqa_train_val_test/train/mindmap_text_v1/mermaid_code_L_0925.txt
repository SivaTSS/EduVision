  Loudness and Intensity of Sound
    Definition
      Loudness
        Perception of sound
      Intensity
        Measure of energy in sound waves
    Relationship
      Intensity affects loudness
      Decibel scale
        Unit of intensity: decibel (dB)
        Loudness increases with decibel level
    Decibel Levels
      Examples
        20 dB - Whisper
        30 dB - Quiet room
        40 dB - Light rainfall
        60 dB - Vacuum cleaner
      Harmful Levels
        High-decibel sounds can damage hearing
    Factors Affecting Intensity
      Amplitude
        Size of sound waves
        Greater amplitude = more energy
      Distance
        Sound spreads over larger area
        Intensity decreases with distance

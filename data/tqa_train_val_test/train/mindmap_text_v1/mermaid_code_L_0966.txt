  Newtons Second Law of Motion
    Definition
      - Acceleration = Net Force / Mass
    Key Concepts
      - Rate of Change of Momentum
      - Force and Acceleration
        - Direct Relationship
        - Doubling Force Doubles Acceleration
      - Force and Mass
        - Inverse Relationship
        - Doubling Mass Halves Acceleration
    Factors Affecting Acceleration
      - Net Force
      - Mass
    Practical Examples
      - Tony vs. Sam
        - Mass Comparison
        - Acceleration Differences
      - Skateboard Example
        - Net Force Acting on Skates
        - Friction's Role

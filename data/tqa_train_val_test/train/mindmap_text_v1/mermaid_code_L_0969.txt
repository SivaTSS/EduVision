  Nonmetals
    Definition
      - Elements that do not conduct electricity
      - Second largest class of elements
      - Located on the right side of the periodic table
    Properties
      - Low boiling points
        - Many are gases at room temperature
        - Some are solids (e.g., carbon, bromine)
      - Poor conductors of heat
      - Dull and brittle in solid form
    Reactivity
      - Variation in reactivity
        - Some are very reactive, others are not
        - Depends on number of valence electrons
      - Example: Fluorine vs. Neon
        - Fluorine: 7 valence electrons, highly reactive
        - Neon: 8 valence electrons, stable and nonreactive
    Conductivity
      - Nonmetals cannot conduct electricity
        - Electrons do not flow freely
        - Reactive nonmetals gain electrons
        - Metals can conduct electricity by giving up electrons

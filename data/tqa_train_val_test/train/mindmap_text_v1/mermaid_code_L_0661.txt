  Respiratory System
    Inhalation
      Definition: Air intake through nose/mouth
      Process: Diaphragm and rib muscles contract
      Effect: Chest volume increases, air pressure decreases
    Exhalation
      Definition: Air expulsion through nose/mouth
      Process: Diaphragm and rib muscles relax
      Effect: Air pressure increases, air pushed out
    Gas Exchange
      Location: Alveoli
      Mechanism: Simple diffusion
        Oxygen: Moves from alveoli to blood
        Carbon Dioxide: Moves from blood to alveoli
    Role of Epiglottis
      Function: Prevents food from entering the trachea
    Breathing vs. Respiration
      Breathing: Movement of air in and out
      Respiration: Includes gas exchange and cellular processes
    Control of Breathing
      Involuntary: Controlled by brain
      Voluntary: Can be controlled during activities (e.g., swimming, singing)

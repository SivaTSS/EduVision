  Alkaline Earth Metals
    Definition
      Group 2 of the periodic table
      Silver or gray in color
      Relatively soft and low density
    Reactivity
      Very reactive
        Gives up two valence electrons
        Increases from top to bottom of the group
      Comparison with alkali metals
        Less reactive than alkali metals
        More energy required to remove two electrons

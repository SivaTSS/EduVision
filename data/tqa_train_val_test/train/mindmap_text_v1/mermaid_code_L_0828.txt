  Chemical Bond
    Definition
      Force of attraction between atoms or ions
      Formed by sharing or transferring valence electrons
    Types of Chemical Bonds
      Covalent Bonds
        Formed between nonmetal atoms
        Involves sharing a pair of electrons
        Example: Water (H2O)
      Ionic Bonds
        Formed between oppositely charged ions
        Creates crystals
        Example: Table salt
      Metallic Bonds
        Attraction between positive metal ions and valence electrons
        Forms a lattice structure
        Example: Copper
    Importance of Chemical Bonds
      Achieve full outer energy level
      Stability of atoms
    Valence Electrons
      Electrons in the outer energy level
      Involved in chemical interactions

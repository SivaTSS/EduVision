  Reaction Rate
    Definition
      - How fast a chemical reaction occurs
    Factors Influencing Reaction Rate
      - Temperature
        - Higher temperature increases reaction rate
        - Particles move faster and collide more forcefully
        - Example: Food spoilage
      - Concentration
        - Number of particles in a given volume
        - Higher concentration increases reaction rate
        - Example: Combustion with oxygen
      - Surface Area
        - More surface area increases reaction rate
        - Example: Rusting of nails vs. solid iron
      - Catalyst
        - Substance that increases reaction rate
        - Not consumed in the reaction
        - Can catalyze multiple reactions
    Collision Theory
      - Explanation of how collisions affect reaction rates
      - Relation to factors influencing reaction rate

  Doppler Effect
    Definition
      Change in frequency of sound waves
      Occurs with moving source relative to listener
    Explanation
      Sound waves bunch up when source approaches
      Sound waves spread out when source moves away
      Higher frequency = higher pitch
      Lower frequency = lower pitch
    Example: Police Car Siren
      Approaching Listener A
        Sound waves closer together
        Higher pitch heard
      Moving Away from Listener B
        Sound waves farther apart
        Lower pitch heard
      After Passing Listener A
        Sudden drop in pitch
        Sound waves spread out

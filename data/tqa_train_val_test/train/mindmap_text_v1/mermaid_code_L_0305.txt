  Seismic Waves
    Properties
      P-waves
        - Fastest waves
        - Travel through solids, liquids, gases
        - Arrive first at seismograph
        - Compression/expansion motion
        - Bend at layer boundaries
        - P-wave shadow zone
      S-waves
        - Slower than P-waves
        - Travel only through solids
        - Arrive second at seismograph
        - Up and down motion
        - Cause change in shape of materials
    Seismology
      - Study of seismic waves
      - Learn about earthquakes
      - Investigate Earth's interior
      - Use of seismographs
    Types of Seismic Waves
      Body Waves
        - P-waves
        - S-waves
      Surface Waves
        - Travel along Earth's surface
        - Slowest seismic waves
        - Cause most damage
    Earth's Interior
      - Inner core
      - Outer core
      - Lower mantle
      - Upper mantle
      - Crust
      - Liquid outer core indicated by S-wave disappearance
      - P-wave behavior at mantle-core boundary

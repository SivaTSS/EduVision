In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the splitting of a nucleus. The first diagram shows the splitting of a uranium nucleus, while the second diagram illustrates the splitting of a plus neutron. The diagrams are labeled with the terms "nucleus splitting" and "plus neutron splitting," respectively.
In both diagrams, there are numerous red dots scattered throughout the images. These dots are likely used to represent the protons and neutrons within the nucleus. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the process of splitting a nucleus, which is an essential concept in nuclear physics.

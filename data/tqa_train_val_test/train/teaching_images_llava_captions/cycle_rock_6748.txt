In the image, there is a circular diagram that illustrates the process of metamorphic rock formation. The process begins with the crystallization of magma, followed by the melting of the magma, and finally, the cooling and solidification of the magma to form the metamorphic rock.
The diagram is divided into four sections, each representing a stage in the process. The first section, labeled "Crystallization," shows the formation of crystals in the magma. The second section, "Melting," illustrates the melting of the magma. The third section, "Cooling & Solidification," depicts the cooling and solidification of the magma to form the metamorphic rock. Finally, the fourth section, "Weathering, Erosion & Deposition," shows the weathering, erosion, and deposition of the metamorphic rock over time.
Overall, the diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the metamorphic rock formation process, from the initial crystallization of magma to the final weathering, erosion, and deposition of the rock.

This is a periodic table of elements. The table is divided into two sections, one for metals and the other for non-metals. The metals section is located on the left side of the table, while the non-metals section is located on the right side.
In the metals section, the elements are arranged from left to right, starting with hydrogen (H) and ending with plutonium (Pu). The non-metals section is also arranged from left to right, starting with hydrogen (H) and ending with uranium (U).
Each element is labeled with its atomic number, symbol, and name. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The symbol is a one- or two-letter abbreviation that represents the element. The name is the common name for the element, such as "hydrogen" or "uranium."

The image depicts a cross-section of the Earth's crust, showcasing the layers of the Earth's interior. The layers include the mantle, the outer core, the inner core, and the crust. The crust is further divided into the continental crust and the oceanic crust.
In addition to the layers of the Earth's crust, the image also displays the concept of Reverse Fault. A Reverse Fault occurs when the ground on one side of a fault moves upward, while the ground on the other side moves downward. This type of fault is often associated with volcanic activity.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the Earth's crust, its layers, and the concept of Reverse Fault.

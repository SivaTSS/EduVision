In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between speed and time. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents speed. The graph is divided into three sections, each representing a different aspect of the relationship between speed and time.
The first section, labeled "steady," represents a constant speed. The second section, labeled "statistical," shows an increase in speed over time. The third section, labeled "returning," illustrates a decrease in speed as time progresses.
In addition to the main graph, there is a smaller graph on the right side of the image. This smaller graph also shows the relationship between speed and time, but it focuses on the "statistical" section of the main graph.

In the image, there is a drawing of the ocean floor and a label that reads "Draw the ocean floor and label it." The drawing depicts a continental shelf, a continental slope, and a continental rise. The continental shelf is the area where the ocean floor meets the continental shelf, while the continental slope is the steep part of the ocean floor that leads to the continental rise. The continental rise is the part of the ocean floor that rises above the continental shelf, and it marks the boundary between the continental shelf and the abyssal plain.

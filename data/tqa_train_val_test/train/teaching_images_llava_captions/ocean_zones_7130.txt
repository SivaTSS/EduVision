The image depicts a cross-sectional view of the Earth's interior, showcasing the various layers and systems that make up our planet. The layers include the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, while the mantle is the layer beneath the crust. The outer core is the layer between the mantle and the inner core, and the inner core is the innermost layer of the Earth.
In addition to these layers, the image also highlights the oceanic system and the tectonic plate system. The oceanic system consists of the oceanic crust and the mantle beneath it, while the tectonic plate system consists of the tectonic plates and the mantle beneath them. The tectonic plates are the large, rigid plates that make up the Earth's surface, and they are constantly moving and interacting with one another.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the Earth's interior, highlighting the various layers, systems, and processes that shape our planet.

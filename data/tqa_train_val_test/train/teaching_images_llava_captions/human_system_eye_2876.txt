The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye, responsible for protecting it from external elements. The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light entering the pupil. The ciliary body is a ring of muscle that helps change the shape of the lens in the eye. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that supplies the retina with oxygen and nutrients.
The retina is the innermost layer of the eye, responsible for processing visual information. The optic nerve is the nerve that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.

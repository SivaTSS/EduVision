The water cycle is a continuous process of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and transpiration. In the image, the water cycle is depicted through a series of diagrams and illustrations.
1. Evaporation: The process begins with the sun heating the water on the surface of the earth, causing it to evaporate into the atmosphere.
2. Condensation: The water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.
3. Precipitation: The water droplets in the clouds grow larger and eventually fall as rain, snow, or hail.
4. Transpiration: Plants, such as trees, absorb water from the soil and release it into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration.
5. Groundwater: The water from the precipitation flows into the ground, forming groundwater.
6. Surface water: The water from the precipitation flows into rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, forming surface water.
7. Repeat: The cycle continues as the water evaporates from the surface of the

In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the different phases of the moon. The moon is shown in various stages, including crescent, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, and waning gibbous.
Each phase of the moon is accompanied by a description of the moon's position relative to the Earth. For example, the waxing crescent phase shows the moon rising above the horizon, while the waning gibbous phase shows the moon setting below the horizon.
In addition to the phases of the moon, the diagram also includes a map of the Earth, highlighting the moon's position relative to the planet. This diagram provides a clear visual representation of the moon's phases and its relationship to the Earth.

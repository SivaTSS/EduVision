In the image, there are two diagrams depicting different types of landscapes. One of the diagrams shows a normal landscape, while the other shows a strike-slip landscape.
In the normal landscape, there is a tree situated in the middle of the scene, surrounded by a grassy area. In the strike-slip landscape, there is also a tree, but it is positioned closer to the left side of the image. The grassy area in the strike-slip landscape is located on the right side of the image.
Both landscapes have a river flowing through them, with the normal landscape having the river closer to the left side, while the strike-slip landscape has the river on the right side of the image.

In the image, there is a total solar eclipse taking place. The moon is passing in front of the sun, casting a shadow on the Earth's surface. The moon's shadow is visible on the left side of the image, while the sun's shadow can be seen on the right side.
There are three diagrams illustrating the different stages of the total solar eclipse. The first one is on the left side of the image, the second one is in the middle, and the third one is on the right side. These diagrams show the progression of the moon's shadow as it moves across the Earth's surface.
In addition to the diagrams, there are two clocks in the image. One clock is located on the left side, and the other clock is on the right side. These clocks may be used to keep track of the time during the total solar eclipse.

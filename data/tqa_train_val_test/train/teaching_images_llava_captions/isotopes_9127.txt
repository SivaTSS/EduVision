The image displays a series of diagrams illustrating the carbon-12 isotopes. There are four diagrams in total, each showing the carbon-12 isotopes in different positions. The diagrams are labeled with the numbers 1, 2, 12, and 13.
In each of the diagrams, the carbon-12 isotopes are represented by orange spheres. The positions of the isotopes are labeled with the numbers 1, 2, 12, and 13. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the carbon-12 isotopes and their positions.

The image shows a detailed diagram of the human brain. The brain is divided into several sections, including the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. The cerebral cortex is the outermost layer of the brain, responsible for processing sensory information and controlling motor functions. The cerebellum is located beneath the cerebral cortex and is responsible for coordinating movement and balance. The brainstem consists of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata, and is responsible for regulating essential bodily functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
In addition to these main sections, the diagram also includes labels for the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the occipital lobe, the temporal lobe, and the limbic system. The frontal lobe is responsible for decision-making, planning, and problem-solving, while the parietal lobe is involved in processing sensory information such as touch and spatial awareness. The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information, and the temporal lobe is involved in processing auditory information.

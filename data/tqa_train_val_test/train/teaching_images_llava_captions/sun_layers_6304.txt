In the image, there is a close-up view of the sun's corona, which is the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere. The corona is filled with plasma and has a temperature of millions of degrees Celsius. The sun's corona is surrounded by a series of concentric circles, each representing a different layer of the sun's atmosphere.
In addition to the corona, there are several other layers of the sun's atmosphere, including the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the convective zone. The photosphere is the visible surface of the sun, while the chromosphere is the layer just below the photosphere, and the convective zone is the region where the sun's plasma is heated and rises to the photosphere.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the sun's various layers and the processes that occur within them.

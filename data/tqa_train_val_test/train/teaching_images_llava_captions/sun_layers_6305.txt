In the image, there is a colorful illustration of the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is divided into several sections, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface to about 7 to 16 kilometers. The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere, extending from about 16 to 50 kilometers. The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere, extending from about 50 to 85 kilometers. The thermosphere is the layer above the mesosphere, extending from about 85 to 610 kilometers. Finally, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere, extending from about 610 to 10,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface.

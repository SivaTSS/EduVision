Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei combine to form a new, heavier nucleus. This process releases a large amount of energy, which can be harnessed to generate electricity. In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of nuclear fusion.
The diagram consists of three main components: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom, while electrons are the negatively charged particles that surround the nucleus. The process of nuclear fusion begins when a proton and a neutron combine to form a new nucleus, releasing energy in the process. This energy can be harnessed to create electricity.
In the image, there is a red arrow pointing towards the center of the diagram, indicating the direction of energy flow during the nuclear fusion process.

In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of hair growth. The diagrams show the stages of hair growth, starting from the hair follicle and ending with the hair shaft.
The first diagram is on the left side of the image, while the second one is on the right side. Both diagrams are labeled with different stages of hair growth, such as anagen, catagen, and telogen.
In addition to the hair growth diagrams, there is a third diagram on the right side of the image, which illustrates the process of sweating. This diagram is labeled with different parts of the sweating process, such as eccrine sweat gland, apocrine sweat gland, and eccrine sweat duct.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive understanding of the hair growth and sweating processes.

In the image, there is a detailed illustration of a nerve cell. The nerve cell is labeled with various parts, such as the cell body, dendrites, axon, and myelin sheath. The cell body is the central part of the nerve cell, while the dendrites are the branching structures that receive signals from other nerve cells. The axon is the long, slender part of the nerve cell that carries signals away from the cell body, and the myelin sheath is a fatty substance that surrounds the axon, providing insulation and protection.
The illustration also includes labels for the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, while the mitochondria are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP. The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that helps in the synthesis of proteins and lipids.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive view of a nerve cell, highlighting its various components and their functions.

The image depicts a thermosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere, troposphere, and the Earth's surface. The thermosphere is the highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, extending from about 80 to 600 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The mesosphere is located between the thermosphere and the stratosphere, extending from about 50 to 85 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The stratosphere is the layer of Earth's atmosphere between the mesosphere and the troposphere, extending from about 18 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The troposphere is the layer of Earth's atmosphere closest to the Earth's surface, extending from about 8 to 20 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The Earth's surface is depicted at the bottom of the image.

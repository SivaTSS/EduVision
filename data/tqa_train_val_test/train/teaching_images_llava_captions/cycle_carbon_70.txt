The image depicts a basic carbon cycle of living systems. The cycle starts with the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then broken down into carbon dioxide and water through the process of cellular respiration. The carbon dioxide is then absorbed by plants through the process of photosynthesis, completing the cycle.
In the image, there are three main components: plants, animals, and air. The plants are represented by a large circle in the middle of the image, while the animals and air are depicted as smaller circles surrounding the main plant circle.

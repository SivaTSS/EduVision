In the image, there is a detailed diagram of the human body, focusing on the respiratory system. The diagram shows the various parts of the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, and diaphragm.
The trachea is a tube-like structure that connects the throat to the lungs. The bronchi are the air passages that lead from the trachea to the lungs. The bronchioles are smaller air passages that branch off from the bronchi. The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is released. The diaphragm is a muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities, helping to move air in and out of the lungs.
In addition to the respiratory system, the diagram also shows the larynx, which is a cartilaginous structure in the throat that houses the vocal cords.

In Layer 1, there is a picture of a bicycle, which is the youngest of the three layers. In Layer 2, there is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is the largest of the three layers. In Layer 3, there is a picture of a rock, which is the oldest of the three layers.
Each layer represents a different aspect of the cross-cutting relationships concept, with the bicycle representing the youngest, the scissors representing the largest, and the rock representing the oldest.

This is a diagram of a DNA molecule. The DNA molecule is composed of four types of nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). These bases are arranged in a specific sequence to form the DNA double helix. The double helix is composed of two complementary strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds between the base pairs.
In the diagram, the nitrogenous bases are color-coded, with adenine and guanine being purple, cytosine being green, and thymine being orange. The double helix is depicted as a blue spiral, with the nitrogenous bases lined up along the length of the spiral. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the structure and composition of a DNA molecule.

In the image, there is a circular diagram showing the phases of the moon. The diagram is divided into eight sections, each representing a different phase of the moon's cycle. The phases are labeled as Full Moon, New Moon, Waxing Gibbous, Waning Gibbous, Waxing Crescent, Waning Crescent, and Last Quarter.
In the center of the diagram, there is a picture of the Earth, emphasizing the connection between the moon's phases and the Earth's rotation. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the moon's phases and their relation to the Earth's orbit around the sun.

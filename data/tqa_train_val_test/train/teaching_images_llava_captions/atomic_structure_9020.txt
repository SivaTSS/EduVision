In the image, there is a representation of an atom's nucleus and electrons. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons, while the electrons are distributed around the nucleus. The electrons are depicted as oranges, and the protons and neutrons are shown as purple circles.
There are a total of six oranges and six purple circles in the image. The oranges are positioned around the nucleus, while the purple circles represent the protons and neutrons. The arrangement of the oranges and purple circles creates a visual representation of an atom's structure.

The image depicts a colorful flowchart illustrating the water cycle. The main components of the water cycle include precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, and runoff.
The flowchart starts with the precipitation process, where water falls from the sky as rain or snow. It then moves on to the evaporation process, where water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, lakes, and rivers. The transpiration process involves the evaporation of water from the leaves of plants, and finally, the runoff process occurs when excess water flows into rivers, lakes, and oceans.
In addition to these main components, the flowchart also includes smaller illustrations, such as a boat and a person, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the water cycle. Overall, the flowchart is a visually appealing and informative representation of the water cycle.

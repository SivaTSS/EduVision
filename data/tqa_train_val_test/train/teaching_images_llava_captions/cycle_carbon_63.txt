The image depicts a symbolic representation of a carbon cycle. The cycle starts with the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars and oxygen. The oxygen is then released back into the atmosphere, completing the cycle.
In the image, there is a tree on the left side of the diagram, representing the process of photosynthesis. Additionally, there is a boat on the right side of the image, symbolizing the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The boat is located near the ocean, which is a significant source of carbon dioxide due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Overall, the diagram provides a visual representation of the carbon cycle, highlighting the role of plants in absorbing carbon dioxide and the impact of human activities on the environment.

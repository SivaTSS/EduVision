In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the chemical reactions between sodium and chlorine, as well as between sodium and potassium. The diagrams show the atoms involved in these reactions, including the sodium, chlorine, and potassium atoms.
In the first diagram, the sodium and chlorine atoms are shown interacting with each other, resulting in the formation of sodium chloride (NaCl). In the second diagram, the sodium and potassium atoms are shown interacting with each other, resulting in the formation of potassium chloride (KCl).
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the chemical reactions that occur when sodium and chlorine, or sodium and potassium, come into contact with each other.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the relationship between water, air, and reflected rays. The diagram is divided into three sections, each representing a different aspect of the relationship.
The first section, on the left side of the image, represents water. The second section, in the middle of the image, represents the air. The third section, on the right side of the image, represents the reflected rays.
There are two arrows in the image, one pointing from the water section to the reflected rays section, and the other pointing from the air section to the reflected rays section. These arrows indicate the flow of energy between the water, air, and reflected rays.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between water, air, and reflected rays.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the relationship between the Earth, the ocean, and the atmosphere. The Earth is at the center of the diagram, surrounded by the ocean and the atmosphere. The ocean is divided into three sections: high tide, low tide, and the tidal zone. The tidal zone is the area where the ocean meets the land, and it experiences the highest and lowest tides.
The atmosphere is depicted as a sphere surrounding the Earth, with the Earth at the center. The Earth is connected to the ocean through the tidal zone, and the ocean is connected to the atmosphere through the high and low tides. This diagram illustrates the complex relationship between the Earth, the ocean, and the atmosphere and how they interact with each other.

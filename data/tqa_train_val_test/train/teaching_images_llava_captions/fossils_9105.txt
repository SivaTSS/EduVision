In the image, there are two diagrams depicting different types of landscapes. The first landscape is a lush green field, while the second landscape is a barren, rocky terrain.
In the green field, there are several dinosaur skeletons scattered throughout the area. Some of these skeletons are closer to the foreground, while others are further in the background.
On the other hand, the rocky terrain is devoid of any dinosaur skeletons. Instead, it features a few trees scattered across the landscape.
Overall, the two diagrams provide a stark contrast between the lush green field and the barren, rocky terrain, with the dinosaur skeletons serving as a focal point in the green field.

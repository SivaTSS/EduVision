The image depicts a detailed diagram of the geological processes involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks. The process begins with the melting of magma, which then cools and solidifies into igneous rocks. Over time, these igneous rocks are subjected to various geological forces, such as weathering and erosion, which cause them to break down into smaller particles. These particles are then transported by water, wind, or ice, and eventually settle at the bottom of a body of water, forming sedimentary rocks.
The diagram illustrates the various stages of this process, including melting, solidification, weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition. Each stage is represented by a different shape or symbol, providing a clear visual representation of the complex geological processes involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.

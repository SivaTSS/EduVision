In the image, there are three diagrams illustrating the process of natural ozone destruction. The first diagram shows an oxygen molecule (O2) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a hydrogen atom (H). The second diagram shows an ozone molecule (O3) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a nitrogen atom (N). The third diagram shows an ozone molecule (O3) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a nitrogen atom (N) along with an oxygen molecule (O2) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a hydrogen atom (H).
In the third diagram, the oxygen molecule (O2) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a hydrogen atom (H) is located on the left side, while the ozone molecule (O3) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a nitrogen atom (N) is located on the right side. The ozone molecule (O3) breaking down into an oxygen atom (O) and a nitrogen atom (N

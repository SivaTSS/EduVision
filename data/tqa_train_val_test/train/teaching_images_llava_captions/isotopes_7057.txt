In the image, there is a diagram showing the structure of a hydrogen molecule. The molecule is composed of two protons, two electrons, and two neutrons. The protons are located at the center of the molecule, while the electrons are positioned around the protons. The neutrons are found in the nucleus of the hydrogen molecule. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the structure of a hydrogen molecule.

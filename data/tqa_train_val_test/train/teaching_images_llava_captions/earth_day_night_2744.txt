The image depicts a globe of the Earth with various lines and angles drawn on it. These lines represent the Earth's axis, which is the imaginary line that runs through the center of the Earth. The globe is divided into two sections, one representing the Northern Hemisphere and the other representing the Southern Hemisphere.
The lines on the globe show the Earth's equator, which is the imaginary line that divides the Earth into two equal halves, as well as the Earth's poles, which are the points at which the Earth's axis intersects the Earth's surface.
In addition to the equator and poles, the globe also shows the Earth's prime meridian, which is the imaginary line that passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. The prime meridian is used as a reference point for determining the longitude of a location on Earth.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the Earth's axis, equator, poles, prime meridian, and hemispheres.

In the image, there is a sunflower planted in a dirt field. The sunflower is located in the center of the image, and the sun is shining brightly above it. The sunflower is surrounded by several arrows pointing in various directions, indicating the process of photosynthesis.
The arrows represent the carbon dioxide (CO2) entering the plant, water (H2O) from the soil, and oxygen (O2) being released back into the atmosphere. This process is essential for the plant's growth and survival, as it converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy and oxygen.
In addition to the sunflower, there is a potted plant on the left side of the image, and a bottle can be seen on the right side.

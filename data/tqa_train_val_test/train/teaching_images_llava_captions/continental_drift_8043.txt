The image displays a series of four diagrams, each focusing on a different aspect of the supercontinent Pangaea. The diagrams depict the breakup of Pangaea into the continents we know today.
In the first diagram, the supercontinent of Pangaea is shown. The second diagram illustrates the breakup of Pangaea into Laurasia (North America and Eurasia) and Gondwanaland (Africa, South America, and Antarctica).
The third and fourth diagrams focus on the future of the continents. The third diagram shows the continents as they were 180 million years ago, while the fourth diagram presents the continents as they are today.
The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the evolution of the Earth's continents over time.

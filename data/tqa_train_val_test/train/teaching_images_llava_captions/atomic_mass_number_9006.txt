In the image, there is a drawing of an atom with two protons, two electrons, and two neutrons. The protons are located at the center of the atom, while the electrons are positioned around the protons. The two neutrons are also present within the atom, with one located closer to the center and the other slightly further away.
The drawing also includes a diagram of an electron configuration, which shows the arrangement of the electrons around the protons. The electrons are arranged in shells, with the first shell containing two electrons, the second shell containing eight electrons, the third shell containing 18 electrons, and the fourth shell containing 32 electrons.
Overall, the image provides a visual representation of the structure and composition of an atom, including its protons, electrons, and neutrons, as well as the electron configuration.

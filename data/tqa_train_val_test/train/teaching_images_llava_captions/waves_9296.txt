In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between a wave's amplitude and its frequency. The wave's amplitude is plotted on the x-axis, while the frequency is plotted on the y-axis. The graph shows that as the frequency increases, the amplitude of the wave decreases, and vice versa.
The wave's amplitude is represented by a red line, while the frequency is represented by a blue line. The red and blue lines intersect at various points, illustrating the relationship between the two variables. The graph provides a visual representation of how the amplitude and frequency of a wave are interconnected.

The image depicts an infographic of the Earth's atmosphere, showcasing different layers of the atmosphere. The layers are labeled as Exosphere, Thermosphere, Mesosphere, and Stratosphere. The Exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere, while the Thermosphere is the layer just above the Mesosphere. The Mesosphere is the layer between the Thermosphere and the Stratosphere, and the Stratosphere is the layer closest to the Earth's surface.
In addition to the layers, the image also displays the Earth's circumference, which is approximately 40,075 kilometers (24,901 miles). This infographic provides a visual representation of the Earth's atmosphere and its relationship to the planet's circumference.

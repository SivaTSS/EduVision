In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the concepts of Reflected Rays and Incident Rays. The Reflected Rays diagram shows the path of light after it has been reflected from a surface, while the Incident Rays diagram shows the path of light before it has been reflected.
In the Reflected Rays diagram, the light rays can be seen entering the surface at an angle, reflecting off the surface, and then exiting the surface at a different angle. The path of the light can be observed as it moves from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
In the Incident Rays diagram, the light rays can be seen entering the surface at an angle, reflecting off the surface, and then exiting the surface at a different angle. The path of the light can be observed as it moves from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
Overall, the diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the concepts of Reflected Rays and Incident Rays.

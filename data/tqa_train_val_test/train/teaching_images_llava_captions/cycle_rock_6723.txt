In the image, there is a detailed diagram illustrating the formation of intrusive igneous rock. The process begins with the formation of magma deep within the Earth's mantle. The magma then rises to the Earth's crust, where it cools and solidifies, eventually forming the intrusive igneous rock.
The diagram shows various stages of the process, including the formation of magma, its rise to the Earth's crust, cooling and solidification, and the final formation of the intrusive igneous rock. Additionally, the diagram highlights the different types of intrusive igneous rocks, such as granite, diorite, and gabbro.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the intrusive igneous rock formation process, from the initial formation of magma to the final solidification of the rock in the Earth's crust.

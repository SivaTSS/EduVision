In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The first diagram is a representation of a convex lens, while the second one is a representation of a concave lens. The diagrams show the curvature of the lenses, with the concave lens having a curved inward shape and the convex lens having a curved outward shape. The diagrams also show the focal points of the lenses, with the focal point of the concave lens being closer to the viewer and the focal point of the convex lens being farther away from the viewer.

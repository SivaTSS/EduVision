In the image, there is a close-up view of a human eye. The eye is divided into several parts, including the cornea, iris, ciliary body, lens, retina, and optic nerve. Each part of the eye is labeled, making it easy to understand the structure and function of the eye.
The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye and is responsible for protecting it from external elements. The iris is the colored part of the eye that controls the amount of light entering the eye. The ciliary body is responsible for producing the lens, which focuses light onto the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of the eye that converts light into electrical signals and sends them to the brain. The optic nerve is the nerve that carries these signals from the retina to the brain.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the human eye, highlighting its various components and their functions.

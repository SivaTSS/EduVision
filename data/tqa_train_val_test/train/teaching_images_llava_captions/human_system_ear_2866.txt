The image shows a detailed diagram of the human ear. The ear is divided into three main parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna, which is the visible part of the ear, and the ear canal. The middle ear contains the eustachian tube, which connects the outer ear to the inner ear, and the ossicones, which are the small bony protrusions on the side of the skull. The inner ear contains the cochlea, which is responsible for hearing, and the vestibular nerve, which carries signals from the inner ear to the brain.
In addition to these main parts, there are several smaller structures within the ear, such as the semicircular canals, which help with balance, and the round window, which connects the middle ear to the inner ear. The diagram also includes labels for the tympanic membrane, the malleus, the incus, the stapes, the hammer, the anvil, the stirrup, the cochlea, the vestibular nerve, the eustachian tube, the ossicones, and the

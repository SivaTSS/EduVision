In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the layers of the Earth. The first diagram shows the Earth's layers, including the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, while the mantle is the layer between the crust and the outer core. The outer core is the layer between the mantle and the inner core, and the inner core is the innermost layer of the Earth.
The second diagram focuses on the plant and animal layer, which is covered with mud. This layer is situated between the crust and the plant and animal layer. The plant and animal layer contains various plant and animal species, while the mud layer acts as a protective barrier against the harsh conditions of the Earth's surface.
Overall, the diagrams provide a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's structure and the various layers that make up our planet.

In the image, there is a representation of the Earth and its atmosphere. The Earth is depicted as a blue globe, while the atmosphere is shown as a red line. The image also features two moons, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the Earth.
The red line represents the red sunset-sunrise light that leaks into the umbra. The umbra is the darkest part of the Earth's shadow cast by the moon during a lunar eclipse. The moons are positioned in such a way that their shadows fall on the Earth's surface, creating a fascinating visual effect during a lunar eclipse.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the relationship between the angle of incidence (i) and the angle of reflection (r). The angle of incidence is the angle at which light enters a surface, while the angle of reflection is the angle at which the light exits the surface. The diagram illustrates that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, as per the law of reflection.
The diagram consists of two triangles, one on the left side and the other on the right side. The left triangle represents the angle of incidence (i), while the right triangle represents the angle of reflection (r). The lines connecting the two triangles show the relationship between the two angles.

In the image, there is a diagram depicting the different levels of wave heights in the ocean. The diagram is divided into three sections, each representing a different level of wave height. The first section is labeled A, the second section is labeled B, and the third section is labeled C.
In addition to the wave heights, the diagram also shows the time required for each wave to reach a specific point. The time required for a wave to reach point A is shown in the first section, the time required for a wave to reach point B is shown in the second section, and the time required for a wave to reach point C is shown in the third section.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the different levels of wave heights and the time required for each wave to reach a specific point in the ocean.

In the image, there is a drawing of a sunflower plant with a root system. The sunflower plant is depicted in various stages of growth, from a small seedling to a full-grown plant. The root system of the sunflower plant can be seen in the lower part of the image.
In addition to the sunflower plant, there is a drawing of a carbon dioxide molecule and an oxygen molecule. The carbon dioxide molecule is located on the left side of the image, while the oxygen molecule is situated on the right side. These drawings help illustrate the process of photosynthesis, where the sunflower plant converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy and oxygen.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the decay of a cobalt-60 nucleus. The cobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of approximately 5.27 years. The decay process involves the emission of gamma rays, which are high-energy electromagnetic radiation.
The diagram illustrates the different stages of the decay process, starting from the initial state of the cobalt-60 nucleus. As the decay progresses, the gamma rays are emitted, causing the nucleus to lose energy and eventually transform into a daughter nucleus. The daughter nucleus, in this case, is a nickel-60 nucleus.
In addition to the diagram, there is a textual explanation of the decay process, which further clarifies the details of the decay of a cobalt-60 nucleus. Overall, the image and text provide a comprehensive understanding of the radioactive decay process of a cobalt-60 nucleus.

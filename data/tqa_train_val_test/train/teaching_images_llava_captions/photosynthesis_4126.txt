In the image, there is a plant with a large red flower and green leaves. The plant is growing in a dirt field, and it appears to be a sunflower. Above the plant, there is a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis.
The diagram shows the sunflower's process of absorbing sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy in the form of glucose and oxygen. The process involves the plant's leaves, where sunlight is absorbed, carbon dioxide is taken in, and water is used. The glucose and oxygen are then transported to other parts of the plant, where they are utilized for growth and energy production.
In addition to the photosynthesis process, the image also shows the sunflower's relationship with other elements, such as light energy, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and glucose. These elements work together to support the plant's growth and overall health.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the example of an alpha decay. Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay that involves the emission of an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons, from the nucleus of an unstable atom.
The diagram illustrates the process of alpha decay, starting with the unstable nucleus and ending with the formation of a new, more stable nucleus. Along the way, the alpha particle is emitted, and the atomic number of the nucleus is reduced by two.
In the image, there are multiple instances of the alpha decay process, each with a different atomic number. This demonstrates the various possible outcomes of alpha decay, depending on the initial state of the unstable nucleus.

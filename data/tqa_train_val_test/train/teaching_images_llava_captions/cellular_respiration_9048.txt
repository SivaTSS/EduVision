In the image, there is a detailed diagram of a cell's metabolic pathway. The pathway consists of several steps, including the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, the conversion of acetyl-CoA to citric acid, the conversion of citric acid to isocitric acid, the conversion of isocitric acid to alpha-ketoglutarate, and the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA.
In addition to the metabolic pathway, the diagram also shows the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, the conversion of succinate to fumarate, the conversion of fumarate to malate, the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate, and the conversion of oxaloacetate to pyruvate.
Overall, the diagram provides a comprehensive view of the cell's metabolic pathway, highlighting the various steps involved in the conversion of glucose to pyruvate and the subsequent conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA

The image depicts the anatomy of a multipolar neuron, which is a type of nerve cell found in the brain and spinal cord. The neuron is composed of various parts, including the cell body, dendrites, axons, and synapses.
The cell body, also known as the soma, is the central part of the neuron where the cell's genetic material is stored. The dendrites are the tree-like structures that extend from the cell body and receive signals from other neurons. The axons are the long, slender structures that extend from the cell body and transmit signals to other neurons. The synapses are the junctions between the axons and dendrites, where signals are transmitted between neurons.
In addition to these main components, the image also highlights the presence of various neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. These neurotransmitters play a crucial role in the functioning of the neuron and the transmission of signals throughout the brain and spinal cord.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive

In the image, there are three diagrams, each depicting a different type of molecule. The first molecule is an oxygen molecule, the second is a carbon dioxide molecule, and the third is an oxygen-carbon dioxide molecule.
The oxygen molecule consists of two oxygen atoms, while the carbon dioxide molecule consists of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. The oxygen-carbon dioxide molecule consists of one oxygen atom, one carbon atom, and two oxygen atoms.
In each of the diagrams, the molecules are represented by their respective symbols. The oxygen molecule is represented by the O2 symbol, the carbon dioxide molecule is represented by the CO2 symbol, and the oxygen-carbon dioxide molecule is represented by the CO2O2 symbol.

In the image, there is a green frog sitting on top of a leaf. The frog is positioned near the center of the image. The leaf is located on the left side of the image.
The main focus of the image is a diagram that illustrates the process of photosynthesis. The diagram is divided into three main sections: light, carbon dioxide, and water. The light section is located on the left side of the image, the carbon dioxide section is in the middle, and the water section is on the right side of the image.
In addition to the main diagram, there are two smaller diagrams on the right side of the image. One of the diagrams is located above the frog, while the other is positioned below the frog. These smaller diagrams likely provide more detailed information about the process of photosynthesis.

In the image, there is a close-up view of the male reproductive system, focusing on the prostate gland and the urethra. The prostate gland is located at the base of the bladder and surrounds the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urethra can be seen extending from the base of the bladder to the tip of the penis.
In addition to the prostate gland and the urethra, the image also shows the bladder, which is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine until it is ready to be expelled through the urethra. The close-up view of the male reproductive system provides a detailed understanding of the anatomy and function of these organs.

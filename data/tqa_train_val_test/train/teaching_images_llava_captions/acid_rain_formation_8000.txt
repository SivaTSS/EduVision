In the image, there is a flowchart depicting the movement of pollutants in the atmosphere. The flowchart consists of a series of arrows pointing in various directions, representing the different stages of the pollutants' movement.
The flowchart starts with the emission of pollutants from various sources, such as factories, vehicles, and agricultural activities. These pollutants are then transported through the air by wind currents, as indicated by the arrows pointing upwards. As the pollutants travel through the atmosphere, they can be absorbed by clouds, as shown by the arrows pointing towards the clouds. Once the pollutants are absorbed by the clouds, they can precipitate as rain or snow, as indicated by the arrows pointing downwards. Finally, the pollutants can be deposited on the ground, as shown by the arrows pointing towards the ground.
This flowchart provides a clear visual representation of the movement of pollutants in the atmosphere, highlighting the importance of controlling these emissions to protect the environment and human health.

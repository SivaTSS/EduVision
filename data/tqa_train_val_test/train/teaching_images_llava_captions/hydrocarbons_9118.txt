In the image, there are two diagrams side by side. The diagrams depict the molecular structure of two different compounds. The first molecule is composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms, while the second molecule is composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms.
In the first molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. In the second molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms, one carbon atom, and one oxygen atom. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the chemical bonds between the atoms in each molecule.

The image depicts a flowchart illustrating the nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is a crucial element in the ecosystem, as it is essential for plant growth and serves as a building block for amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
The flowchart begins with the process of nitrogen fixation, where nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is converted into a form that can be used by plants. This process is carried out by certain bacteria, which convert the nitrogen gas into ammonia.
Next, the ammonia is converted into a form that can be used by plants through the process of nitrification. This involves the conversion of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates, which are essential for plant growth.
The nitrogen cycle continues with the process of denitrification, where nitrogen compounds are broken down into nitrogen gas, which can be returned to the atmosphere. This process is carried out by certain bacteria and fungi.
Finally, the nitrogen cycle concludes with the process of nitrogen fixation, where nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is

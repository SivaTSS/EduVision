The image depicts a double helix DNA strand. The strand is color-coded, with each color representing a specific amino acid. There are 20 amino acids in total, and each amino acid is represented by a different color. The colors are arranged in such a way that they create a visually appealing and easy-to-understand representation of the DNA strand.
In addition to the color-coded amino acids, there are two arrows in the image. One arrow is pointing upwards, while the other is pointing downwards. These arrows are likely used to indicate the direction in which the DNA strand is growing or replicating.
Overall, the image provides a clear and concise representation of the double helix DNA strand and the amino acids that make up its structure.

In the image, there is a diagram showing the relationship between the wavelength and the crest of a wave. The crest is the highest point of the wave, and the wavelength is the distance between two successive crests. The diagram illustrates how the crest of a wave changes as the wavelength increases or decreases.
There are several labels on the diagram, including B, C, D, E, and F. These labels likely represent specific points or measurements related to the wave and its crest. The diagram provides a visual representation of the relationship between the wavelength and the crest of a wave, making it easier to understand and analyze.

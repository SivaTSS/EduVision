In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of acid rain formation. Acid rain is formed when pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, are released into the atmosphere. These pollutants react with moisture in the air to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which then fall to the ground as acid rain.
The diagram shows the various stages of acid rain formation, including the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, the formation of sulfuric and nitric acids in the presence of moisture, and the precipitation of these acids as acid rain. Additionally, the diagram highlights the impact of acid rain on the environment, such as the corrosion of buildings, statues, and other structures, as well as the harm it can cause to plants and aquatic life.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the process of acid rain formation and its consequences on the environment.

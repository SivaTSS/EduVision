In the image, there is a diagram that illustrates the relationship between wave height, wave length, and wave period. The wave height is shown on the left side of the diagram, while the wave length is on the right side. The wave period is depicted in the middle of the diagram.
The diagram is divided into three sections. The first section, labeled "Wave Height," shows the relationship between the wave height and the wave period. The second section, labeled "Wave Length," shows the relationship between the wave length and the wave period. The third section, labeled "Wave Period," illustrates the relationship between the wave period and the wave height.
In addition to the main diagram, there are two smaller diagrams on the right side of the main diagram. The first smaller diagram shows the relationship between the wave height and the wave length, while the second smaller diagram illustrates the relationship between the wave period and the wave length.

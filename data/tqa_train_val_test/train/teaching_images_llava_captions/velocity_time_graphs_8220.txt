In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between constant acceleration, constant deceleration, and constant velocity. The x-axis represents the time in seconds, while the y-axis represents the velocity in meters per second.
The graph is divided into three sections: constant acceleration, constant deceleration, and constant velocity. In the constant acceleration section, the velocity increases linearly over time. In the constant deceleration section, the velocity decreases linearly over time. In the constant velocity section, the velocity remains constant over time.
The graph is labeled with various numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. These numbers likely represent specific points on the graph.

In the image, there is a circular diagram that illustrates the process of air cooling. The diagram is divided into four sections, each representing a different stage of the cooling process.
The first section, labeled "cool air sinks," shows that cooler air sinks, while warmer air rises. The second section, "cool dense air sinks," demonstrates that cooler, denser air sinks, while warmer, less dense air rises. The third section, "cool light air sinks," shows that cooler, lighter air sinks, while warmer, heavier air rises. Lastly, the fourth section, "warm air sinks," illustrates that warmer air sinks, while cooler, denser air rises.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the air cooling process, highlighting the relationship between temperature, air density, and air movement.

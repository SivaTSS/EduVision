In the image, there is a diagram showing the structure of a molecule. The molecule is labeled as Valence Electrons. The diagram consists of a large circle in the center, which represents the nucleus of the molecule. Surrounding the nucleus are several smaller circles, which represent the valence electrons of the molecule. These valence electrons are the outermost electrons that determine the chemical properties of the molecule. The diagram provides a clear visual representation of the structure and composition of the molecule.

In the image, there is a graph displaying two different types of wave patterns. The first wave pattern is a series of zig-zag lines, while the second wave pattern is a series of curved lines. The zig-zag lines are located on the left side of the graph, while the curved lines are located on the right side of the graph.
The zig-zag lines and the curved lines appear to be different types of wave patterns, with the zig-zag lines being more irregular and the curved lines being smoother and more organized. The graph provides a visual representation of these two distinct wave patterns, allowing for a better understanding of their differences and similarities.

The image shows a series of diagrams illustrating the stages of human embryonic development. There are six diagrams in total, each depicting a different stage of the development process.
In the first diagram, a single cell is shown, representing the fertilized egg. In the second diagram, the cell divides into two cells, and in the third diagram, the two cells divide into four cells. The fourth diagram shows the four cells dividing into eight cells, and the fifth diagram displays the eight cells dividing into sixteen cells. Finally, the sixth and last diagram shows the sixteen cells dividing into thirty-two cells, representing the blastocyst stage.
Each of the diagrams is labeled with the corresponding stage of embryonic development, making it easy for viewers to understand the progression of the process.

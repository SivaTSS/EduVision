This is a periodic table of elements. The table consists of 118 elements arranged in rows and columns. The elements are labeled with their atomic numbers, symbols, and names. The table is organized in such a way that elements with similar chemical and physical properties are grouped together.
The table is divided into several sections, including metals, non-metals, halogens, noble gases, and lanthanides and actinides. The metals section includes elements such as hydrogen, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and iron. The non-metals section includes elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. The halogens section includes elements such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The noble gases section includes elements such as neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. The lanthanides and actinides sections include elements such as lanthanum, cerium, and uranium.
Each element is labeled with its atomic number, symbol, and name. For example, hydrogen is labeled with the atomic number 1, the symbol

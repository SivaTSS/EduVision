In the image, there are two diagrams depicting the chemical reactions of lithium and fluorine. The first diagram shows the process of lithium reacting with fluorine to form lithium fluoride. The second diagram illustrates the process of lithium fluoride reacting with water to form lithium hydroxide and hydrogen fluoride.
In both diagrams, there are multiple red and green dots representing the atoms involved in the reactions. The red dots represent the lithium and fluorine atoms, while the green dots represent the hydrogen and oxygen atoms involved in the reactions. The diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the chemical reactions between these elements.

  Technological Design Process
    Definition
      Process for developing new technology
    Steps
      Identify Problem
        Identify a problem to solve
      Research
        Gather information about the problem
      Generate Solutions
        Brainstorm possible solutions
      Select Best Solution
        Choose the best solution from the options
      Create Model
        Design a physical representation of the solution
      Test Model
        Evaluate the model's effectiveness
      Refine and Retest
        Make improvements and test again
      Communicate Solution
        Share the final solution with others
    Similarities to Scientific Investigation
      Both rely on evidence and reason
      Both follow a logical sequence of steps
    Limitations and Constraints
      Factors such as cost and safety
    Importance of Testing and Refining
      Ensures the design works to solve the problem
      Allows for problem-solving and modification
    Example: Tri-ATHLETE Robot
      Designed to solve specific problems
      Tested and refined through multiple versions
      Final solution communicated to others
    Application: Designing a Solar-Powered Car
      Researching questions about design
      Developing possible solutions
      Creating and testing a model
      Refining and improving the design
    Application: Designing a Personal Item Carrier
      Researching questions about design
      Developing

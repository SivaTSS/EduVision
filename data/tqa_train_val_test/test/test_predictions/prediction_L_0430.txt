  Genetics
    Definition of Gene and Allele
      Gene: section of a chromosome containing genetic code for a protein
      Allele: different versions of a gene
    Relationship between Genotype and Phenotype
      Genotype: combination of alleles inherited from parents
      Phenotype: expression of genotype as a trait
    Predicting Genotype and Phenotype Ratios
      Punnett Square: tool for predicting possible genotypes and phenotypes
      Dominant and Recessive Alleles
        Dominant: expressed in heterozygotes (e.g., B allele for violet flower color)
        Recessive: only expressed in homozygotes (e.g., b allele for white flower color)
    Complex Traits
      Codominance: both alleles expressed equally in heterozygotes
        Example: red and white flower
      Incomplete Dominance: dominant allele not completely dominant
        Example: pink flower with incompletely dominant allele for red petals
    Multiple Allele and Polygenic Traits
      Multiple Allele Trait: multiple alleles for a single gene
      Polygenic Trait: multiple genes controlling a single trait
    Environment's Influence on Traits
      Skin color: influenced by genes and

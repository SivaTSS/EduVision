  Archaea
    Types of Archaea
      Halophiles
        Living in salty environments
        Found in Great Salt Lake, Dead Sea
      Thermophiles
        Living in extremely hot environments
        Can thrive in temperatures near 100C
      Methanogens
        Produce methane
        Live in swamps, inside cows and termites
    Cell Wall
      Differences from bacteria
        Unique phospholipids
        Allow archaea to withstand harsh environments
    Discovery
      First found in extreme environments
      Distinguished by environment in which they live
    Soil
      Abundant in soil
      Important roles in the environment
    Ocean
      Found among plankton
      Discovery of their roles ongoing
    Mutualistic Relationships
      Methanogens and animals
      Breakdown of cellulose
      Example of mutualism

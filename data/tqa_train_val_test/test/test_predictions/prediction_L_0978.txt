  Pascals Law
    Definition
      - Enclosed fluid
      - Pressure change transmitted equally
    Example
      - Toothpaste tube
        - Squeeze tube
        - Pressure transmitted
        - Force at open end
    Application
      - Hydraulic brakes
        - Pressure transmission
        - Force increase
      - Hydraulic car lifts
        - Heavy objects lifting
        - Pressure transmission
      - Airplane controls
        - Pressure transmission
        - Force increase

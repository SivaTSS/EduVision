  Wind Erosion
    Causes
      Dry, bare soil
      Size of particles
    Mechanisms
      Abrasion
        Rough sediments
        Scouring and polishing
      Suspension
        Tiny particles
        Long distance travel
      Saltation
        Larger particles
        Short distance travel
      Traction
        Larger than sand
        Rolling or pushing
    Deposits
      Sand Dunes
        Formation
          Obstacle
          Wind slowing
          Deposition
        Migration
          Gravity pull
          Direction
      Loess
        Fine particles
        Vertical cliffs
        Rich soil
    Prevention
      Plant Coverage
        Roots
        Water retention
      Rows of Trees
        Wind slowing
      Fences
        Beach sand dunes
    Comparison
      Clay, Sand, Pebbles
        Transport methods
        Differences in movement

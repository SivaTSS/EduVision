  Extinction and Radiation of Life
    Definition of Extinction
      Normal part of Earth's history
      Two ways to go extinct: die out or evolve into a different species
    Mass Extinctions
      Causes: comets, asteroids, volcanic eruptions, climate change
      Effects: many species go extinct in a short amount of time
    Adaptive Radiation
      Definition: many new species evolve in a short period to fill available niches
      Example: mammals after the extinction of the dinosaurs
    Phylogenetic Tree
      Branching structure
      Indicates evolutionary relationships between species
    Speciation
      Definition: one species evolves into two different species
      Requirement: ability to mate
    Evolutionary Processes
      Act rapidly during mass extinctions
      Result in many new species
    Biodiversity
      Definition: variety of life forms in a given area
      Effects of mass extinctions: decrease or increase
    Three-Spined Sticklebacks
      Example of speciation
      Natural selection in Loberg Lake, Alaska
    Honeycreepers in Hawaii
      Example of adaptive radiation
      Species evolved to fill available niches
    Extinction Rates
      Most species that have lived have gone extinct
      Mass ext

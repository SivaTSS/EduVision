  Punnett Squares
    Definition
      Tool for predicting offspring from a cross
      Uses laws of probability
    Steps to Create
      1. Parent factors: top of square
      2. Parent factors: left side of square
      3. Pull factors into boxes
    Example
      Cross between purple flowers (Bb)
    Calculation
      Percentage of offspring with certain trait
    Mendels Rules of Heredity
      1. Dominant factors mask recessive factors
      2. Each parent contributes one factor
    Crosses
      Black rabbit x White rabbit
      Hybrid Ff rabbits
    Offspring Appearance
      Potential offspring from crosses
    Practice
      Using Punnett squares to predict offspring
    Trait Dominance
      Dominant trait: purple flowers
      Recessive trait: white flowers
    Cross with White Flower
      Cross between white flower (bb) and purple flower (Bb)
    Offspring Percentages
      Percentage of purple and white offspring
    Conclusion
      Dominant trait is purple in pea plants

  Natural Selection
    Definition
      Process by which organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers
    Evolution
      Occurs by natural selection
      Inherited traits change over time
    Inherited vs Acquired Traits
      Inherited: passed from one generation to the next
      Acquired: developed over a lifetime
    Adaptation
      Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment
    Natural Selection Process
      1. Variation in inherited traits
      2. Advantageous traits for survival and reproduction
      3. Offspring inherit advantageous traits
    Examples
      Arctic hares: white fur helps hide from predators
      Giant tortoises: long necks help reach high food sources
    Importance
      Ensures survival of species in changing environments
    Species Diversity
      Between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet
      Increases chance of survival in changing environments
    Sources of Variation
      Genetic mutations
      Recombination in sexually reproducing organisms
    Natural Selection Requirements
      1. Variation in inherited traits
      2. Advantageous traits for survival and reproduction
      3. Offspring inherit advantageous traits

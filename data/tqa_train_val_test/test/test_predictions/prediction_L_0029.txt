  Climate
    Definition
      Average weather over many years
      Includes average temperatures, precipitation, and timing of precipitation
    Factors Affecting Climate
      Latitude
        Temperature changes with latitude
          Directness of Sun's rays
          Poles have lowest temperatures
        Global air currents
          Create wet and dry zones at different latitudes
          Create global winds
        Ocean currents
          Influence coastal climate
          Affect temperature of atmosphere and climate
      Nearby oceans
        Coastal climate
          Mild temperatures
          High precipitation
        Inland climate
          More extreme temperatures
          Lower precipitation
      Mountains
        Air temperature falls at higher altitudes
          Less dense air
          Fewer collisions
        Rain shadows
          Cast by mountain ranges
          Dry conditions on leeward side
    Predicting Climate
      Based on location
      Similar locations may have same climate

Input: Lesson: climate and its causes

6. An ocean current flows from north to south off the western coast of a continent. The current flows close to land at 50 N latitude. Predict how the current affects the climate of the coast at that latitude. Explain your prediction.

One winter day in Chicago, the temperature hit 20 C (68 F). This

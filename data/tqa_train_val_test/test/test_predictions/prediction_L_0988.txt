  Pressure in Fluids
    Definition
      Pressure defined
        Force acting on a given area
        Measures concentration of force
    SI Unit
      Pascal (Pa)
        N/m2
        Equation for pressure
          Pressure = Force/Area
    Factors Influencing Pressure
      Depth
        Greater depth = greater pressure
        More weight pressing down
      Density
        Dense fluids exert more pressure
        Closer particle collisions
    Examples
      Siphon
        Liquid movement
        Uphill flow
        No backflow
      Pushpin
        Force concentration
        Pressure increase
      Calculating Pressure
        Force and area
        Pressure equation
        Force calculation
          Force = Pressure * Area
    Applications
      Break-dancer
        Weight and pressure
        Balancing on hand
        Lying down on ground

  Learned Behavior of Animals
    Methods of Learning
      Habituation
        - Forming a habit
        - Getting used to something after exposure
        - Example: Crows becoming used to a scarecrow
      Observational Learning
        - Learning by watching and copying others
        - Example: Young wolves learning hunting skills from older wolves
      Conditioning
        - Learning through rewards or punishments
        - Example: Training a dog to fetch a ball
      Play
        - Learning skills needed as adults
        - Example: Kittens learning to be better predators
      Insight Learning
        - Learning from past experiences and reasoning
        - Example: Making tools to solve problems
    Examples of Learned Behavior
      Tool Use
        - Octopus opening jars
        - Gorilla using a walking stick
      Conditioning
        - Bees learning to find nectar in certain flowers
        - Human children learning to study for tests
      Observational Learning
        - Human children learning to tie their shoes
        - Monkeys learning to wash their food
    Implications for Animal Intelligence
      Flexibility of Learned Behavior
        - Ability to change behavior if conditions change
        - Example: Learning a new route to school
      Dependence on Learned Behavior
        - Humans rely on learned behavior more

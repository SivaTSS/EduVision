  Boyle's Law
    Definition
      - States that if temperature is constant, pressure increases as volume decreases
    Explanation
      - Pressure increases due to increased collisions between gas molecules
    Experiment
      - Squeezing a balloon to decrease its volume increases its pressure
    History
      - Discovered by Robert Boyle in the 1660s
      - Known as the father of modern chemistry
    Graph
      - Inverse relationship between gas volume and pressure
    Implications
      - Used in various scientific applications
      - Understanding gas behavior is essential in many fields

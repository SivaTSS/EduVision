  Amphibians
    Definition
      Vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land
      First vertebrates to evolve four legs and colonize the land
      Ectothermic
    Traits
      Moist skin without scales
      Mucus secreted by mucous glands
      Keratin in skin allows gases and water to pass through
      Digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems use a single body cavity (cloaca)
      Relatively complex circulatory and nervous systems
      Sensory organs for smelling, tasting, eyes, and ears
      Larynx for making sounds
    Reproduction
      Sexual reproduction
      Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body
      Oviparous (eggs develop outside the mother's body)
      Larval stage different from adult form
      Tadpoles have gills and a long tail for swimming
      Metamorphosis changes tadpole to adult form
    Classification
      Three orders: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians
      Frogs include toads and have the most species
      Caecilians have the fewest species
    Ecological Roles
      Prey of many other vertebrates
      Important

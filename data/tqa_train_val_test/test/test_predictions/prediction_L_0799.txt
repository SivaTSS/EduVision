  Amontons Law
    Definition
      Increasing temperature of a gas while holding its volume constant increases pressure
    Explanation
      Gas particles heat up and gain energy
      Faster movement causes more collisions and greater pressure
    Demonstration
      Sealed jug containing air
      Heating air increases pressure
    Real-World Application
      Tire pressure example
        Friction between tires and road generates heat
        Increased temperature causes pressure increase
    Experiment
      Father's classic experiment
        Small piece of paper in glass bottle
        Lit paper causes egg to slip inside bottle

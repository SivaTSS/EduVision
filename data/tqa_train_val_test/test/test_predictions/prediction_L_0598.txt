  Genetics
    Definition
      Study of inheritance
    Mendel's Experiments
      Pea plants chosen for study
        Easily identifiable traits
        Rapid growth
        Self-pollination or cross-pollination
      Results
        No blending of traits
        Consistent inheritance patterns
    Mendel's Contributions
      Father of genetics
      Inheritance patterns for multiple traits
      Disproved "blend" theory of traits
    Key Concepts
      Simple traits
        Single gene trait
      Heterozygote vs Homozygote
        Heterozygote: two different alleles
        Homozygote: two identical alleles
      Trait Breeding
        Yellow wrinkled peas with yellow smooth peas
        Green wrinkled plants

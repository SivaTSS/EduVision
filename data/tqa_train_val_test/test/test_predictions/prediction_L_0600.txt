  Evolution
    Microevolution
      Definition
        Small changes over time
      Examples
        Mosquitoes resistant to pesticides
      Characteristics
        Changes within a species
        No new species created
    Macroevolution
      Definition
        Larger evolutionary changes
      Examples
        New species creation
      Causes
        Repeated microevolution
        Major environmental changes
    Species
      Definition
        Group of organisms with similar characteristics
      Characteristics
        Genetic similarity
        Ability to mate and produce fertile offspring
    Cambrian Explosion
      Definition
        Rapid appearance of diverse animal life
      Timing
        Approximately 540 million years ago
      Significance
        Major event in evolutionary history
    Evolutionary Changes
      Gradual vs. Drastic
        Both small and large changes possible
      Microevolution
        Small changes within a species
        No new species created
      Macroevolution
        Large changes leading to new species
        Can occur through repeated microevolution or major environmental changes

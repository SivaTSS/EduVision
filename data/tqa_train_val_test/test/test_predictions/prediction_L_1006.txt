  Replication in Science
    Definition
      Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated
    Importance
      Checking work
        Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory
        If results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect
      Replication in Practice
        Example of vaccine-autism study
          Initial study found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism
          Other researchers tried to replicate the study but could not find a link
          Investigators determined that the original study was a fraud
    Reasons for Replication
      To confirm results
      To check work
      To turn a hypothesis into a theory
    Limitations
      Not every investigation is repeated
      Time and resources required for replication
    Consequences of Incorrect Results
      Epidemics and deaths due to unvaccinated children
      Financial losses due to fraudulent research

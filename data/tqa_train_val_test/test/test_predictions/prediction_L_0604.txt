  Modern Genetics
    Genotype
      Definition
        Combo of alleles
        Example: TT, Tt, tt
    Phenotype
      Definition
        Traits observable
      Connection to Genotype
        Genotype expresses phenotype
        Example: Tall vs Short
    Alleles
      Definition
        Variants of genes
    Mendel's Work
      Foundation of modern genetics
      Questions left unanswered
    DNA
      Genetic material
      Encodes genes
    Chromosomes
      DNA wound into chromosomes
      Homologous pairs
    Genetic Factors
      Dominant and recessive factors
    Allele Types
      Dominant vs Recessive
        Dominant: Affects phenotype in homozygous condition
        Recessive: Only affects phenotype in homozygous condition
    Genotype and Phenotype
      Homozygous vs Heterozygous
        Homozygous dominant (TT)
        Homozygous recessive (tt)
        Heterozygous (Tt)

  Food Webs
    Definition
      Food Chain
        Single pathway of feeding interactions
        Arrows show feeding relationships
        Example: plant grasshopper bird snake owl
      Food Web
        Multiple intersecting pathways
        Example: Arctic Ocean ecosystem
    Importance
      Energy Flow
        Constant need for energy
        Organisms eat other organisms
        Producers, consumers, decomposers
    Differences
      Food Chain vs Food Web
        Food chain: single pathway
        Food web: multiple intersecting pathways
    Components
      Producers
        Beginning of food chain
        Create energy through photosynthesis
      Consumers
        Herbivores, carnivores
        Use glucose for energy
      Decomposers
        Break down dead organisms
        Recycle nutrients
    Food Web Construction
      Requirements
        Contain producers, consumers, decomposers
        Show feeding relationships
      Number of Food Webs
        Multiple possibilities
        Complex ecosystems
    Food Chain Example
      Phytoplankton
        Krill
          Fish
            Shark
    Food Web Example
      Arctic Ocean ecosystem
        Loons, Arctic Tern
          Beluga, Sea Duck
            Zooplankton feeders

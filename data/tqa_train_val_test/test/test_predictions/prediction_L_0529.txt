  Fungi Reproduction
    Asexual Reproduction
      Spores
        Formed by fungi
        Released to create new fungi
        Haploid reproductive cells
        Genetically identical offspring
      Budding
        Fungus grows new part of body
        Breaks off to form new organism
      Fragmentation
        Piece of mycelium splits off
        Fragment can produce new colony
    Sexual Reproduction
      Zygospore
        Results from two parents
        Increases genetic diversity
      Mating Types
        (+) and (-) hyphae
        Fuse to form mycelium with sporangia
    Advantages
      Asexual Reproduction
        Faster reproduction
        More offspring
      Sexual Reproduction
        Increases genetic diversity
        Adaptive to a wider range of environments

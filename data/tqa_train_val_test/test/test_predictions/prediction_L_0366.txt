      Tropisms
        Gravitropism
          Roots grow downward due to gravity
        Phototropism
          Stems and leaves grow toward light
      Daily and Seasonal Changes
        Growth and Development
          Dormancy in fall
          Leaf changes and fall
        Defense Against Disease
          Cell death around infected tissue
          Hormones and toxins
    Special Adaptations
      Aquatic Plants
        Advantages
          Plenty of water
          Less support needed
        Challenges

          Light penetration
      Xerophytes
        Adaptations
          Increase water intake
          Decrease water loss
          Store water
      Epiphytes
        Growth on other plants
        Support from host trees
        Increased light exposure
      Carnivorous Plants
        Nutrient source
          Insects or small animals

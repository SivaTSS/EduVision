  Scientific Induction
    Inductive Reasoning
      Definition
        Process of drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence
      Use in Science
        Basis of the scientific method
        Draw general conclusions from evidence
        Change conclusions based on new evidence
      Characteristics
        Cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true
        May lead to conclusions that are very likely to be true
    Example
      Planet Quim
        No gravity
        Objects never fall to the ground
        Observations on Earth
          Objects fall to the ground
          Round objects rise into the sky
        Inductive Reasoning
          Conclusion: All objects fall to the ground on Earth
          Additional Evidence: Objects lighter than air do not fall to the ground
          Revised Conclusion: Objects heavier than air fall to the ground but objects lighter than air do not
    Crime Solving
      Detective's Role
        Gather clues
        Identify suspects
        Find enough evidence to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect
    Scientific Method
      Role of Inductive Reasoning
        Draw general conclusions from evidence
        Change conclusions based on new evidence
        Support scientific theories with evidence
    Conclusion
      Inductive reasoning is a powerful tool for solving crimes and understanding the natural world
      It cannot prove conclus

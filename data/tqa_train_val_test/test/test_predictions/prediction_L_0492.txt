  Competition
    Intraspecific Competition
      Definition
        Organisms of the same species
        Strive for limited resources
      Examples
        Trees competing for light
        Two trees growing close together
        One tree growing taller to get more light
        Better adapted organism survives
    Interspecific Competition
      Definition
        Organisms of different species
        Strive for limited resources
      Examples
        Cheetahs and lions feeding on similar prey
        Lions catching more prey than cheetahs
        Cheetahs leaving the area or decreasing population
    Competitive Exclusion Principle
      Definition
        Species less suited to compete for resources
        Adapt, move from the area, or die out
    Character Displacement
      Definition
        Two species within the same area
        Develop different specializations
      Examples
        Different birds adapting to eat different types of food
        Different types of bills for eating different types of food
    Evolution through Natural Selection
      Definition
        Competition for resources
        Role in evolution
      Examples
        Better adapted organism survives
        Less adapted organism dies out
        Adaptation, movement, or death
    Resources
      Definition
        Limited resources
        Importance in competition
      Examples
        Food, water, light, space

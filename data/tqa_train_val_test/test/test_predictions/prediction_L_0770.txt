  Gas Behavior
    Pressure
      Definition
        Force per unit area
      Explanation
        Particles bumping into things
        Atmosphere pressure
          Sea level pressure
           10.14 N/cm^2 (14.7 psi)
    Gas Laws
      Boyles Law
        Inverse relationship
          Volume and Pressure
          Increasing volume decreases pressure
          Graph: Figure 4.12
      Charles Law
        Direct relationship
          Temperature and Volume
          Increasing temperature increases volume
          Graph: Figure 4.14
      Amontons Law
        Direct relationship
          Volume and Temperature
          Increasing temperature increases pressure
          Graph: Figure 4.15
    Changes of State
      Cooling a Gas
        Possible change to liquid
        Energy role
      Weather Balloon
        Rising and Expanding
          Less pressure, more volume
        Bursting
          Volume increase stretches container
    Applications
      Scuba Diving
        Air bubbles increasing in volume
      Tire Pressure
        Increasing pressure with temperature

  Tropisms
    Definition
      Growth towards or away from a stimulus
    Types
      Phototropism
        Stimulus: Light
        Growth: Towards light
        Example: Leaves and stems
      Gravitropism
        Stimulus: Gravity
        Growth: Towards or away from gravity
        Example: Roots and shoots
      Thigmotropism
        Stimulus: Touch
        Growth: Around a stimulus
        Example: Tendrils
    Mechanism
      Auxins
        Hormones that cause growth
        Move to one side of the stem
        Cause rapid cell growth on that side
        Result: Bending
    Experiments
      Phototropism
        Signal in growing tip
        Migration up and down
        Agar block
        Hormone: Auxin
    Conclusion
      Importance of tropisms
        Adaptation to environment
        Survival and growth
        Phototropism, gravitropism, and thigmotropism

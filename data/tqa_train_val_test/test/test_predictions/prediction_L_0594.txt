  Mammal Reproduction
    Monotremes
      Egg-laying
      Leathery eggs
      Similar to reptiles and birds
    Marsupials
      Live young
      Born immature
      Develop in pouch
      Examples: kangaroos, koalas, opossums
    Placental Mammals
      Live young
      Develop in womb
      Placenta allows nutrient exchange
      Examples: cats, dogs, people
    Mating Systems
      Group of females and one male
      Seal species
      Male elephant seals larger than females
    Sexual Dimorphism
      Differences between sexes
      Size differences
      Dominant males in mating
    Reproductive Strategies
      Monotremes: egg-laying
      Marsupials: pouch development
      Placental mammals: placenta development
    Placenta
      Allows nutrient exchange
      Keeps wastes from fetus
      Umbilical cord function
    Marsupial Reproduction Process
      Parental care differences
      Marsupial babies find pouch
      Licking during birth
    Marsupial vs Placental Mammals
      Primary difference: development location
      Marsupials: pouch development
      Placental mammals: placenta

  Ecosystem Change
    Ecological Succession
      Definition
        Process in which species numbers and types change over time
    Primary Succession
      Definition
        Occurs in an area never colonized by living things
      Pioneer Species
        Bacteria and lichens
        Grow on bare rock
      Soil Formation
        Organic matter added to soil
        Improves soil and holds water
    Secondary Succession
      Definition
        Occurs in a formerly inhabited area disturbed
      Pioneer Species
        Grasses and other small plants
      Soil Already in Place
        Faster than primary succession
    Climax Community
      Definition
        Stable state of an ecosystem
      Likelihood
        Rare in real-world ecosystems
        Disturbances prevent climax communities
    Human Impact
      Environmental Problems
        Caused by human actions
      Effects on Living Things
        Various impacts on ecosystems
    Conclusion
      Ecosystems are dynamic
      Continued change is likely

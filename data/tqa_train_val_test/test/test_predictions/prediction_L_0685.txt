  Ecological Succession
    Definition
      Constant replacement of one community by another
    Types of Succession
      Primary Succession
        Occurs on new lands
        Pioneer species: lichens
        Soil formation: lichens break down rock
      Secondary Succession
        Occurs in established areas
        Pioneer species: grasses
        Soil already exists
    Stages of Succession
      Early Succession
        Grasses and shrubs
      Later Succession
        Small trees and shrubs
    Climax Communities
      End result of succession
      Stable balance of populations
      Depends on climate
    Sub-Climax Communities
      Maintained by human activities
      Example: American Prairie
    Impact of Human Activities
      Cattle grazing
        Affects sage brush and grasses
      Fire
        Aided spread of American Prairie
        Source: lightning

  Development of Theories
    Scientific Theory
      Explanation of complex phenomena
      Provides model of reality
      Offers reliable explanations
      Makes accurate predictions
      Constantly tested and revised
      Strongly supported by evidence
      No major inconsistencies
      Less likely to be overthrown
    Scientific Law
      Describes something that always happens
      Applies under the same conditions
      Simpler phenomenon than theory
      May have exceptions
    Hypothesis
      Initial idea or guess
      Tested with evidence
      May become a theory or law
    Relationship between Theories and Laws
      Theory explains why something happens
      Law describes what always happens
      Laws can be exceptions to the rule
      Theories can be revised or thrown out
    Importance in Science
      Hypothesis: initial idea or guess
      Theory: strongly supported explanation
      Law: always applies under same conditions
      All important in science
    Evidence in Science
      Supports or refutes a hypothesis
      No significant evidence to refute
      Enormous evidence to support
      Accepted as a theory

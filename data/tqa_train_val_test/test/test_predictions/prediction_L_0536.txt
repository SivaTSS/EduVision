  Habitat Destruction
    Definition
      Natural home or environment of an organism
    Causes
      Clearing land for agriculture and development
        Agriculture: doubled land use, half of wetlands, tallgrass prairies gone
        Deforestation: slash-and-burn agriculture, tropical rainforests
        Invasive species: non-native species, out-compete native species, extinction
        Other causes: poor fire management, overfishing, mining, pollution, storm damage
    Effects
      Extinction: loss of species, irreversible changes to habitat and ecosystem
      Desertification: turning forest into desert, loss of top soil, nutrients
    Solutions
      Habitat preservation: protecting natural habitats, reducing human impact
      Invasive species control: preventing introduction, eradicating existing species
      Sustainable practices: reducing deforestation, promoting conservation efforts
      Education and awareness: informing public about habitat destruction, promoting conservation
    Consequences
      Loss of biodiversity: extinction of species, disruption of ecosystems
      Economic impact: loss of resources, reduced tourism, increased costs
      Social impact: loss of cultural heritage, reduced quality of life
    Case Studies
      Cape May, New Jersey: wetland filtering water, protecting coastal lands

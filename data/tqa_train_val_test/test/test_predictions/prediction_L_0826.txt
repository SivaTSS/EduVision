      - Law that describes the relationship between the temperature and volume of a gas, assuming constant pressure
    Effects of Temperature on Gas Volume
      - Increasing temperature increases gas volume
      - Decreasing temperature decreases gas volume
    Explanation
      - Heating a gas gives particles more energy
      - Particles move faster and spread out, increasing volume
    Real-World Examples
      - Hot air balloons
      - Balloons inflated on a hot day and then cooled
    Historical Context

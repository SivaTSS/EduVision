  Gases
    Definition
      State of matter
      Particles can pull apart
      No fixed shape or volume
    Properties
      Spread out to fill space
      Pressure created by particles
    Pressure
      Force against a given area
      Depends on number and speed of particles
    Atmospheric Pressure
      Greatest at sea level
      Decreases with altitude
    Air Pressure Effects
      Cake baking
      High altitude instructions
    Experiment
      Two identical sealed boxes
      Air particles represented by dots
      More air particles in box B
      Volume of air is the same in both boxes
    Conclusion
      Air pressure is greater in box B
      Due to more air particles and faster movement

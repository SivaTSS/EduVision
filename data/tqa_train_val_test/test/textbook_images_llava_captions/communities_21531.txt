In the image, there is a close-up view of a white worm with a long tail. The worm appears to be wriggling on a surface, possibly a piece of meat. The tail of the worm is quite long, extending from the middle of the worm towards the right side of the image. The worm's body occupies a significant portion of the image, stretching from the left to the right side of the frame.

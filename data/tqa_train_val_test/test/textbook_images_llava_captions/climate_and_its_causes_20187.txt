In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between air temperature and the height of a ship. The graph has a steep slope, indicating that as the air temperature increases, the height of the ship decreases, and vice versa. The relationship between air temperature and the height of a ship is an important factor to consider when designing and operating ships, as it affects various aspects such as stability, fuel efficiency, and safety.

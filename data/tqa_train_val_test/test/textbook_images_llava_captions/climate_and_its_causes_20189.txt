The image depicts the concept of a rain shadow, which is an area where rainfall is significantly reduced due to the presence of a mountain or a large body of water. In this case, the rain shadow is located on the side of a mountain, where the air cools and condenses, resulting in precipitation on the opposite side of the mountain.
The diagram illustrates the process of rising air cooling and condensing as it moves up the side of the mountain. As the air rises, it cools, causing water vapor to condense into droplets. These droplets eventually become raindrops and fall on the opposite side of the mountain, creating the rain shadow.
In the image, there are several arrows pointing upwards, indicating the movement of the air as it rises and cools on the side of the mountain. Additionally, there is a small illustration of a mountain on the right side of the image, emphasizing the concept of the rain shadow.

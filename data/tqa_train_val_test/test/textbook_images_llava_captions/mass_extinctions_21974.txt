In the image, there is a bird with a long beak standing in a grassy area. The bird appears to be a kiwi, which is a bird native to New Zealand. The bird's beak is long and curved, which is a characteristic feature of kiwis. The bird is standing on one leg, possibly resting or observing its surroundings. The grassy area provides a natural habitat for the bird, offering shelter and a place to forage for food.

In the image, there is a flowchart depicting the process of conducting scientific experiments. The flowchart consists of multiple circles, each representing a step in the experiment process. The circles are arranged in a linear fashion, with the first circle on the left side of the flowchart and the last circle on the right side.
The flowchart begins with the formation of a hypothesis, followed by the collection of data through observations and experiments. Next, the data is analyzed to test the hypothesis, and finally, conclusions are drawn based on the results of the experiment.
In addition to the flowchart, there is a magnifying glass located at the top left corner of the image, symbolizing the close examination of the data during the experiment process.

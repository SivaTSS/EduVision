In the image, there are two cylinder-shaped objects, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the image. These objects are labeled as "cyclone" and "anticyclone," indicating that they are related to weather phenomena.
In addition to the two main objects, there are several smaller arrows scattered throughout the image. Some of these arrows are located near the edges of the image, while others are positioned closer to the main objects. These smaller arrows might be used to further explain or illustrate the concepts related to the "cyclone" and "anticyclone" objects. Overall, the image provides a visual representation of these weather-related concepts.

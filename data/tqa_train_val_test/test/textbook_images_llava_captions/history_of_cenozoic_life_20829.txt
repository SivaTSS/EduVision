In the image, there is a skeleton of a large carnivorous animal, possibly a saber-toothed tiger or a hyena, on display in a museum. The skeleton is posed in a way that makes it appear as if it is walking or running. The animal's ribcage is clearly visible, showcasing its anatomy.
In addition to the main skeleton, there are several other smaller skeletons scattered throughout the scene. Some of these smaller skeletons can be seen in the background, while others are positioned closer to the main skeleton. The presence of these smaller skeletons suggests that this exhibit may be part of a larger display or exhibit in the museum.

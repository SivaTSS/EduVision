In the image, there is an airplane flying in the sky, and a hawk is soaring above it. The hawk's wings are spread out as it glides through the air. Below the hawk and the airplane, there is a car driving on the road. The scene captures the contrast between the natural world of the hawk and the man-made world of the airplane and the car.

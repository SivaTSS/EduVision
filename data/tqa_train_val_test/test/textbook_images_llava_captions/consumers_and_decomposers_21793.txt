In the image, there is a close-up view of a mushroom growing out of a tree trunk. The mushroom is surrounded by a purple substance, which appears to be a bacterial infection. In the background, there is another image of the same mushroom growing out of the tree trunk, but without the purple substance. The close-up view of the mushroom and the purple substance can be seen on the left side of the image, while the background image of the mushroom can be seen on the right side of the image.

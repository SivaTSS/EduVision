In the image, there is a graph showing the global land-ocean temperature index from 1880 to 2012. The temperature index is displayed on a logarithmic scale, making it easier to visualize the changes in temperature over time.
The graph shows that the temperature index has been steadily increasing since the early 1900s, with a noticeable spike in the 1970s. The overall trend of the temperature index is upward, indicating a rise in global temperatures over the past century and a half.

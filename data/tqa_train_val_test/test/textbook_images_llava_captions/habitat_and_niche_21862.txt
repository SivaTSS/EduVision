In the image, there are three horses standing in a grassy field. The first horse is on the left side of the image, the second horse is in the middle, and the third horse is on the right side. The horses appear to be looking at each other, possibly engaging in social behavior. The grassy field provides a natural environment for the horses to graze and interact with one another.

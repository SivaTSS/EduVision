In the image, there is a large moss-covered rock surrounded by smaller rocks. The moss-covered rock is located in the middle of the scene, and it appears to be the focal point of the image. The smaller rocks are scattered around the moss-covered rock, with some positioned closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The combination of the large moss-covered rock and the surrounding smaller rocks creates an interesting and visually appealing scene.

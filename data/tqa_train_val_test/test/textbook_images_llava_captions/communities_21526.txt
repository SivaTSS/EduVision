In the image, there is a line graph showing the relationship between two variables. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis displays the value of the second variable. The graph is divided into three sections, each representing a different time period.
In the first section, there is a significant increase in the value of the second variable. In the second section, the value of the second variable starts to decrease. Finally, in the third section, the value of the second variable continues to decrease, but at a slower pace.
There are also two arrows in the graph, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. These arrows indicate the direction of the relationship between the two variables, with the upward arrow representing an increase in the value of the second variable and the downward arrow representing a decrease in the value of the second variable.

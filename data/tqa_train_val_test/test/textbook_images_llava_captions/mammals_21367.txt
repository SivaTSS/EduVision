In the image, there is a close-up of a manatee's face as it swims in a body of water. The manatee has its mouth open, and it appears to be eating a leaf. The manatee's face is the main focus of the image, with the rest of its body partially visible in the background. The manatee's eyes are open, and it seems to be enjoying its time in the water.

In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the process of evaporation and condensation in the atmosphere. The diagrams are labeled "Sea Breeze" and "Land Breeze."
In the "Sea Breeze" diagram, the process starts with the sun heating the water in the ocean. As the water heats up, it evaporates and turns into water vapor. The water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses into tiny water droplets. These droplets form clouds, which eventually release the water back into the ocean.
In the "Land Breeze" diagram, the process starts with the sun heating the land. As the land heats up, it evaporates and turns into water vapor. The water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses into tiny water droplets. These droplets form clouds, which eventually release the water back into the ocean.

In the image, there is an illustration of an oxygen molecule with the number 8 on it. The oxygen molecule is represented by a red circle, and the number 8 can be seen in the middle of the circle. The illustration is accompanied by a key that provides information about the oxygen molecule.
The key explains that the oxygen molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The two hydrogen atoms are positioned on either side of the oxygen atom, with one on the left and the other on the right. The oxygen atom is located in the middle of the molecule, and the number 8 represents the atomic weight of the oxygen atom, which is 16.
Overall, the illustration and key provide a clear understanding of the structure and composition of an oxygen molecule.

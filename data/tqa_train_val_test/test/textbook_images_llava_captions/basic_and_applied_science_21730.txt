In the image, there is a long row of wind turbines lined up on a sandy beach near the ocean. The wind turbines vary in height, with some being taller than others. They are all facing the same direction, capturing the power of the wind to generate electricity.
In addition to the wind turbines, there are a few people scattered throughout the scene, likely enjoying the beach or observing the turbines. The combination of the wind turbines and the ocean creates a picturesque and eco-friendly atmosphere.

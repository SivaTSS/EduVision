In the image, there is a graph showing the atmospheric pressure over time. The pressure is plotted on the y-axis, and the time is plotted on the x-axis. The graph shows that the atmospheric pressure varies throughout the day, with the highest pressure occurring during the daytime and the lowest pressure occurring during the early morning and late evening hours.

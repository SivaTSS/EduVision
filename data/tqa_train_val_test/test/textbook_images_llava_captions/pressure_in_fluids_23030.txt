In the image, there are two side-by-side diagrams depicting two different scenarios. One of the diagrams features blue spheres, while the other has white spheres. The blue spheres are scattered throughout the image, while the white spheres are more concentrated in the center of the image.
In the first scenario, the blue spheres are spread out across the entire image, while in the second scenario, the white spheres are clustered together in the center of the image. The diagrams provide a visual representation of the differences between the two scenarios, with the blue spheres being more dispersed and the white spheres being more centralized.

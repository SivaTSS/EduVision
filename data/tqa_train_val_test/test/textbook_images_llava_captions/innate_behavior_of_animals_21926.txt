In the image, there are two ducks in a body of water. One of the ducks is standing on the edge of the water, while the other duck is swimming in the water. The duck standing on the edge of the water appears to be looking at the other duck swimming in the water. The body of water could be a lake or a pond, and the ducks seem to be enjoying their time in the water.

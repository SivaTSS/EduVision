In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between temperature and degrees Celsius. The x-axis represents the temperature in degrees Celsius, while the y-axis shows the corresponding temperature on the Fahrenheit scale.
There are several dots on the graph, each representing a specific temperature in degrees Celsius. The dots are scattered across the entire range of the x-axis, from -80 to 80 degrees Celsius. The graph provides a visual representation of the conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures.

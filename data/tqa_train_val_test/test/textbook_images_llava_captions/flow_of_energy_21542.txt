In the image, there is a large pile of insects, specifically grasshoppers, on the ground. The grasshoppers are scattered all over the area, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. There are at least 13 grasshoppers visible in the image, with some of them being larger than others. The scene appears to be a natural habitat for these insects, where they can thrive and interact with one another.

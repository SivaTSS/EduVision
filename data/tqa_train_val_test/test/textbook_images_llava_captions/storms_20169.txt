In the image, there is a large, dark storm cloud hovering over a grassy field. The cloud appears to be spinning, indicating the presence of a tornado. The tornado is located in the middle of the field, and it appears to be growing in size as it moves closer to the viewer.
In addition to the tornado, there are several birds scattered throughout the scene. Some birds can be seen flying near the top of the image, while others are positioned closer to the ground. The combination of the storm cloud and the birds creates a dynamic and dramatic atmosphere in the image.

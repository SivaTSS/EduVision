In the image, there are two birds, one black and the other white. The black bird is standing over the white bird, which appears to be a baby bird. The black bird has its beak open, possibly feeding the baby bird. The scene takes place near a body of water, where the birds are perched on a branch. There are also several other birds in the background, adding to the lively atmosphere of the scene.

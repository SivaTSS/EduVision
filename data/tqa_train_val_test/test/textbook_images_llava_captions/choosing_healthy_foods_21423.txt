This is a table that shows the nutritional values of various foods. The table is divided into different sections, each containing information about a specific type of food. For example, there are sections for proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Each section lists the amount of the nutrient per serving, as well as the daily value and the percentage of the daily value that the serving provides. The table also provides a quick guide to DV (Daily Value), which is a standardized system for measuring the nutritional content of foods. The table is organized in a way that makes it easy for users to compare the nutritional content of different foods and make informed decisions about their diet.

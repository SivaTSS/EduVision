In the image, there are two white flowers with yellow centers. One of the flowers is located on the left side of the image, while the other is on the right side. The yellow centers of the flowers are labeled with the word "sepal," indicating that they are the sepals of the flowers. The sepals are a part of the flower's reproductive organs, and they play a crucial role in the process of pollination.
In addition to the sepals, the image also shows the presence of petals, which are another part of the flower's reproductive organs. The petals are responsible for attracting pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, and facilitating the transfer of pollen from one flower to another.
Overall, the image provides a close-up view of the flower's reproductive organs, highlighting the importance of the sepals and petals in the process of pollination and reproduction.

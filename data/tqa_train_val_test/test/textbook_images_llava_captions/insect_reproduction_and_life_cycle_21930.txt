In the image, there is a green butterfly chrysalis hanging from a tree branch. The chrysalis is in the process of transforming from a caterpillar to a butterfly. The chrysalis is attached to the tree branch, and it appears to be in the middle of the metamorphosis process. The butterfly will eventually emerge from the chrysalis once the transformation is complete.

The image displays a globe of the Earth, with the North Pole and the South Pole marked on it. The North Pole is located at the top of the globe, while the South Pole is situated at the bottom of the globe.
In addition to the North Pole and the South Pole, the globe also shows the Equator, which is the imaginary line that divides the Earth into two equal halves. The Equator runs through the middle of the globe, connecting the North Pole and the South Pole.
There are also two arrows on the globe, one pointing towards the North Pole and the other pointing towards the South Pole. These arrows help to emphasize the location of the poles on the globe.

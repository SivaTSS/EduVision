In the image, there are two diagrams illustrating the human respiratory system. The first diagram shows the rib cage and the diaphragm, with the rib cage on the left side and the diaphragm on the right side. The second diagram focuses on the diaphragm and the rib cage, with the diaphragm on the left side and the rib cage on the right side.
In both diagrams, the diaphragm is depicted as a muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities. The rib cage is shown as a bony structure that surrounds and protects the lungs and other internal organs.

In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between two variables. The x-axis represents one of the variables, while the y-axis represents the other variable. The graph has a downward slope, indicating a negative relationship between the two variables.
There are two arrows in the image, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the graph. The arrow on the left side is pointing upwards, while the arrow on the right side is pointing downwards. These arrows suggest the direction of the relationship between the two variables, with the arrow on the left indicating a positive relationship and the arrow on the right indicating a negative relationship.

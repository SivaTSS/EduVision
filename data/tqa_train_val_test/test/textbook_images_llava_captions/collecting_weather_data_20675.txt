In the image, there are two side-by-side pictures of the same hurricane. The hurricane is located in the Caribbean Sea, and it appears to be intensifying. The two pictures show the progression of the hurricane over a period of time.
In the first picture, the hurricane is located in the middle of the Caribbean Sea, while in the second picture, the hurricane has grown in size and is now positioned more towards the left side of the Caribbean Sea. The intensity of the hurricane can be observed as it progresses from one picture to the other.

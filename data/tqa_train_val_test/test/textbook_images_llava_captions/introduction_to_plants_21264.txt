In the image, there are three baby birds sitting in a nest made of twigs. The nest is located in a tree, surrounded by green leaves. The birds are positioned close to each other, with one bird on the left side, another in the middle, and the third bird on the right side of the nest. The birds appear to be sleeping or resting comfortably in their cozy nest.

In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of DNA replication. The process begins with a DNA strand, which is then replicated into two identical DNA strands. The replicated DNA strands are then cut out of the original DNA strand, resulting in four identical DNA strands. These four DNA strands are then reassembled into the original DNA strand, completing the process of DNA replication.
In addition to the DNA replication process, the diagram also shows the process of plasmids being cut out of the DNA strand. The plasmids are then reassembled into the original DNA strand, completing the process of plasmid replication.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the complex process of DNA replication and plasmid replication.

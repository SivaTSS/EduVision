In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of nutrient cycling in an aquatic ecosystem. The main components of the diagram include primary producers, nutrients, consumers, and decomposers.
The primary producers, such as algae and phytoplankton, are responsible for converting sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients into organic matter through the process of photosynthesis. Nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are essential for the growth of these primary producers.
Consumers, including herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, play a crucial role in the ecosystem by feeding on the primary producers. Decomposers, such as bacteria and fungi, break down the organic matter produced by the primary producers and consumers, returning nutrients to the soil and water.
In the image, the primary producers, nutrients, consumers, and decomposers are depicted in various stages of the nutrient cycling process. The primary producers are shown

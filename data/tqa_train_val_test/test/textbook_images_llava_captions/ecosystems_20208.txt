In the image, there are two pictures depicting the life cycle of a tree. The first picture shows a tree with green leaves, while the second picture shows a dead tree stump. The text accompanying the images explains the process of a tree's life cycle, including the growth of the tree, the process of photosynthesis, and the eventual death of the tree.
The text also highlights the importance of trees in our ecosystem, as they provide oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and create habitats for various species. Additionally, the text emphasizes the role of dead tree stumps in the ecosystem, as they serve as part of the small ecosystem and provide habitats for fungi and other organisms.
Overall, the image and accompanying text provide a comprehensive understanding of the life cycle of a tree and its role in the ecosystem.

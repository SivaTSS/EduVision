In the image, there is a close-up view of a blue background with two long, thin, and curved objects placed on it. The objects appear to be made of rubber or plastic, and they are positioned in such a way that they resemble a pair of scissors. The scissor-like objects are located on the left and right sides of the blue background, with the left one being slightly larger than the right one. The overall appearance of the objects gives the impression of a pair of scissors, even though they are not actual scissors.

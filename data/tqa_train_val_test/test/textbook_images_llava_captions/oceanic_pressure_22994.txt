The image depicts a graph showing the atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude. The x-axis represents the altitude in thousands of feet, while the y-axis shows the atmospheric pressure in inches of mercury (inHg).
There are several points on the graph, indicating the pressure at different altitudes. The pressure decreases as the altitude increases, which is consistent with the concept of atmospheric pressure decreasing with altitude. The graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure.

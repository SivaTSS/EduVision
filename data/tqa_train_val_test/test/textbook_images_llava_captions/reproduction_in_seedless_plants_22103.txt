In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the alternation of generations in ferns. The diagram is divided into three sections, each representing a different stage in the life cycle of a fern.
The first section displays the sporophyte, which is the reproductive part of the fern. The second section shows the gametophyte, which is the sexual reproductive part of the fern. Finally, the third section illustrates the fertilization process, where the sperm from the male gametophyte fertilizes the egg from the female gametophyte, resulting in the formation of a new sporophyte.
In addition to the diagram, there is a picture of a fern plant in the background, providing a visual representation of the alternation of generations in ferns.

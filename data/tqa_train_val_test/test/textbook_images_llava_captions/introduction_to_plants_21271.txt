In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the process of fertilization in a plant. The diagram is divided into three main sections: the egg, the sperm, and the zygote. The egg is located at the bottom left corner of the image, while the sperm is positioned at the top left corner. The zygote, which is the fertilized egg, is located in the middle of the image.
In addition to these three main sections, there are several smaller circles scattered throughout the image. These smaller circles likely represent different stages or components of the fertilization process. Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the process of fertilization in a plant.

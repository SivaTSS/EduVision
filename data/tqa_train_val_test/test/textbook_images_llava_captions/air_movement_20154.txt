In the image, there is a large blue circle that represents the Earth's atmosphere. Inside the circle, there are multiple arrows pointing in different directions, indicating the winds blowing across the globe. The arrows are labeled with the names of the winds, such as trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies.
In addition to the winds, there is a smaller circle within the larger circle, which represents the Earth's surface. The smaller circle is surrounded by the larger blue circle, emphasizing the relationship between the atmosphere and the Earth's surface.

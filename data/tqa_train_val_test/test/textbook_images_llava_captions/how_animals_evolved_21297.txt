In the image, there is a detailed illustration of the human body, focusing on the musculoskeletal system. The illustration shows the different layers of the muscle, including the skeletal muscle, the muscle belly, and the muscle fiber.
In addition to the musculoskeletal system, the illustration also highlights the ectoderm, which is one of the three primary germ layers in the development of the human body. The ectoderm is responsible for the formation of the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin.
Overall, the image provides a comprehensive understanding of the human body's musculoskeletal system and the ectoderm's role in the development of the epidermis.

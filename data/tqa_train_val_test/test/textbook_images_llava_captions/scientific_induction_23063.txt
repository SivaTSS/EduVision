In the image, a yellow measuring tape is placed next to a red substance on the ground. The red substance appears to be a stain, possibly a blood stain. The measuring tape is used to measure the size of the stain, which is approximately 7 centimeters in length. The presence of the stain and the measuring tape suggests that the scene might be related to a crime investigation or a forensic examination.

In the image, there is a large cactus with two birds perched on it. The cactus is located in the middle of the scene, and the birds are sitting on opposite sides of the cactus. One bird is on the left side of the cactus, while the other bird is on the right side. The cactus appears to be a natural habitat for these birds, providing them with a place to rest and observe their surroundings.

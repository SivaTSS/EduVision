In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the concept of an "Occluded Front." The diagram is divided into three main sections. The first section is titled "Occluded Front," and the second section is titled "Advancing Cold Air." The third section is titled "Receding Warm Moist Air."
In the "Occluded Front" section, there are two arrows pointing in opposite directions. The first arrow is pointing upwards, while the second arrow is pointing downwards. The second section, "Advancing Cold Air," has an arrow pointing upwards, and the third section, "Receding Warm Moist Air," has an arrow pointing downwards.
There is also a map symbol in the bottom right corner of the image, which might be related to the concept of the "Occluded Front."

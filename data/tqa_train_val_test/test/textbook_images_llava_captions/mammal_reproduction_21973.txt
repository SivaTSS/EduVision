The image depicts a herd of seals gathered on a rocky beach. There are at least 14 seals visible in the scene, with some standing and others laying down. The seals are spread out across the beach, with some closer to the foreground and others further in the background. The seals appear to be relaxed and enjoying their time on the beach.

In the image, there is a visual representation of the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is depicted as a series of layers, including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and the exosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from the Earth's surface up to about 7 to 16 kilometers (4 to 10 miles). The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere, extending from about 16 to 50 kilometers (10 to 31 miles). The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere, extending from about 50 to 85 kilometers (31 to 53 miles). The thermosphere is the layer above the mesosphere, extending from about 85 to 600 kilometers (53 to 373 miles). Finally, the exosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere, extending from about 600 to 10,000 kilometers (373 to 6,214 miles) above the Earth's surface.

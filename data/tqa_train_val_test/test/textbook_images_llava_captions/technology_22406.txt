Fiber optics is a technology that uses light to transmit information over long distances. In the image, there are two diagrams explaining the concept of fiber optics. One of the diagrams shows a fiber optic cable with a light source at one end and a light detector at the other end. The light source emits light, which travels through the fiber optic cable and reaches the light detector. The light detector then converts the light signal into an electrical signal, which can be processed by a computer or other electronic devices.
The other diagram illustrates the structure of a fiber optic cable. It consists of a core made of glass or plastic, surrounded by a cladding layer made of a material with a lower refractive index than the core. The cladding layer helps to prevent light from leaking out of the core and ensures that the light remains confined within the cable. The outer layer of the fiber optic cable is typically made of a material with a higher refractive index than the cladding layer, which reflects the light back into the core.
In summary, fiber optics is a technology that uses light to transmit information

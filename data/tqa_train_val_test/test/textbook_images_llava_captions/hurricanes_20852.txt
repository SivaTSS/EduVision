The image depicts a flooded city with a large body of water covering the streets. Buildings can be seen on both sides of the water, with some appearing to be submerged in the floodwaters.
In the midst of the floodwaters, there are several vehicles, including cars and trucks, scattered throughout the scene. Some of these vehicles are closer to the water's edge, while others are further away.
Additionally, there are two traffic lights visible in the image, one on the left side and the other on the right side of the flooded street. The presence of these traffic lights suggests that the city's infrastructure is still functional despite the flooding.

In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the relationship between Convection Currents, Wind, and Air. The diagram is divided into three main sections. The first section is the Convection Currents, which are represented by a circular shape. The second section is the Wind, represented by an arrow pointing upwards. The third section is the Air, also represented by an arrow pointing upwards.
There are also smaller arrows pointing in different directions throughout the diagram, possibly indicating the movement of air or wind currents. Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between Convection Currents, Wind, and Air.

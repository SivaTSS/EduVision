In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the workings of a car's brake system. The diagram is divided into three main sections: the brake fluid, the brake drum, and the brake shoes.
The brake fluid is located at the top of the diagram and is connected to the brake shoes through a series of tubes. The brake drum is situated in the middle of the diagram, and the brake shoes are positioned at the bottom of the diagram.
In addition to the main components of the brake system, there are several arrows pointing in various directions throughout the diagram. These arrows likely indicate the flow of the brake fluid, the rotation of the brake drum, and the movement of the brake shoes during the braking process.
Overall, the diagram provides a clear visual representation of the intricate workings of a car's brake system.

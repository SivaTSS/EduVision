In the image, there is an illustration of a snake wrapped around a tree trunk. The snake is depicted in various colors, including green, yellow, and orange. The tree trunk appears to be made of wood, and the snake seems to be coiled around it.
In addition to the snake and the tree trunk, there are two birds in the scene. One bird is located near the top left corner of the image, while the other bird is situated near the top right corner. These birds seem to be interacting with the snake and the tree trunk, adding a sense of liveliness to the illustration.

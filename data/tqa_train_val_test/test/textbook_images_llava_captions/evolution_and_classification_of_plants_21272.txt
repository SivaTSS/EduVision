In the image, there are two diagrams side by side, each depicting a plant's life cycle. The diagrams are labeled "vascular" and "non-vascular" plants.
The "vascular" plant diagram shows the stages of a plant's life cycle, starting from a seed and ending with flowering plants. The stages include germination, growth, flowering, fruiting, and seed dispersal.
On the other hand, the "non-vascular" plant diagram shows the stages of a moss plant's life cycle. The stages include germination, growth, reproduction, and spore dispersal.
Both diagrams provide a clear visual representation of the plant life cycle, highlighting the differences between vascular and non-vascular plants.

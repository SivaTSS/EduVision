The image depicts two diagrams illustrating the water cycle. The first diagram shows the process of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, while the second diagram focuses on the process of condensation and precipitation.
In the first diagram, the water evaporates from a body of water, such as a lake, and rises into the atmosphere. As it rises, it cools and condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. These clouds eventually release the water as precipitation, either in the form of rain or snow.
In the second diagram, the focus is on the process of condensation and precipitation. The water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into water droplets, forming clouds. These clouds eventually release the water as precipitation, either in the form of rain or snow.
In both diagrams, trees can be seen in the background, indicating that the water cycle is taking place in a natural environment.

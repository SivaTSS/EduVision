In the image, there is a diagram illustrating the concept of "Cold Front." The diagram is divided into three main sections: "Advancing Cold Air Behind Cold Front," "Direction of Frontal Movement," and "Cloud Development Due to Frontal Lift of Warm Moist Air."
The "Advancing Cold Air Behind Cold Front" section is located on the left side of the diagram, while the "Direction of Frontal Movement" section is in the middle. The "Cloud Development Due to Frontal Lift of Warm Moist Air" section is situated on the right side of the diagram.
In addition to these main sections, there is a small arrow pointing towards the right side of the diagram, possibly indicating the direction of the frontal movement.

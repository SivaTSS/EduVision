In the image, there is a flowchart that shows the process of constructing a hypothesis. The flowchart is divided into three main steps: construct a hypothesis, test your hypothesis by doing an experiment, and test your hypothesis by doing an experiment.
The first step is to construct a hypothesis, which involves constructing a hypothesis by doing an experiment. The second step is to test your hypothesis by doing an experiment. The third and final step is to test your hypothesis by doing an experiment.
In the flowchart, there are arrows pointing from one step to the next, indicating the progression from one step to the next. The flowchart is color-coded, with green representing the first step, yellow representing the second step, and black representing the third and final step.

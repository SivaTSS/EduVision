In the image, there is a colorful pyramid-shaped diagram that illustrates the different types of consumers. The pyramid is divided into four sections, each representing a specific group of consumers.
At the base of the pyramid, there are primary consumers, such as herbivores, insects, and small mammals. Above them, there are secondary consumers, including carnivores and omnivores. The next level consists of tertiary consumers, such as large mammals, birds, and reptiles. Finally, at the top of the pyramid, there are quaternary consumers, such as eagles and other large birds of prey.
Each section of the pyramid is labeled with the corresponding type of consumer, providing a clear visual representation of the food chain.

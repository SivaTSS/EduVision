In the image, there is a diagram that shows the evolutionary relationships between different species of animals. The diagram is organized in a pyramid-like structure, with each level representing a different group of animals.
At the top of the pyramid, there is a group labeled "Kingdom," which includes all living organisms. Below that, there is a group labeled "Phylum," which is further divided into "Chordates" and "Animals." The "Chordates" group includes fish, amphibians, and reptiles, while the "Animals" group includes mammals, birds, and insects.
Below the "Animals" group, there is a group labeled "Class," which is further divided into "Mammals" and "Animals with a backbone." The "Mammals" group includes humans and other mammals, while the "Animals with a backbone" group includes fish, amphibians, and reptiles.
Below the "Animals with a backbone" group, there is a group labeled "Order," which is further divided into "Mammals" and "Anim

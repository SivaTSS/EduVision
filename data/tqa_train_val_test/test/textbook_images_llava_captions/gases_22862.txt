The image depicts a graph showing the relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure. The y-axis represents the altitude in meters, while the x-axis shows the atmospheric pressure in millibars. The graph is divided into three sections: Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Troposphere.
In the Stratosphere section, the atmospheric pressure decreases as the altitude increases. In the Mesosphere section, the atmospheric pressure continues to decrease, but at a faster rate. Finally, in the Troposphere section, the atmospheric pressure starts to increase as the altitude rises. The graph provides a clear visual representation of the atmospheric pressure and altitude relationship.

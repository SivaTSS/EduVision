"What happens to a candle in a vacuum?" and "How does a light bulb work?"
In addition to the questions and illustrations, the notebook also has a section dedicated to the periodic table of elements. This section provides a visual representation of the elements and their properties, making it easier for students to understand and remember them.
Overall, the notebook is a creative and interactive learning tool designed to engage students in the study of physics and other scientific concepts.

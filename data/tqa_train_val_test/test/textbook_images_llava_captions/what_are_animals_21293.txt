The image depicts a circular diagram illustrating the process of fertilization. At the center of the diagram, there is an egg, which represents the female reproductive organ. The male reproductive organ, represented by a sperm, is shown approaching the egg from the left side of the diagram.
As the sperm makes its way towards the egg, it passes through the female reproductive organs, including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus. The ovaries are located on the left side of the diagram, while the fallopian tubes and uterus are situated on the right side.
In addition to the sperm and the egg, the diagram also features a zygote, which is formed when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The zygote is located in the center of the diagram, surrounded by the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the process of fertilization and the development of a zygote.

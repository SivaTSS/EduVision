In the image, there is a graph showing the relationship between wind speed and wind direction. The x-axis represents the wind direction, and the y-axis represents the wind speed. The graph shows that as the wind direction increases, the wind speed decreases, and vice versa.
There is also a diagram showing the relationship between wind direction and wind speed. The y-axis represents the wind speed, and the x-axis represents the wind direction. The graph shows that as the wind direction increases, the wind speed decreases, and vice versa.
Additionally, there is a diagram showing the relationship between wind direction and wind pressure. The y-axis represents the wind pressure, and the x-axis represents the wind direction. The graph shows that as the wind direction increases, the wind pressure decreases, and vice versa.
Lastly, there is a diagram showing the relationship between wind speed and wind pressure. The y-axis represents the wind pressure, and the x-axis represents the wind speed. The graph shows that as the wind speed increases, the wind pressure decreases, and vice versa.

In the image, there is a graph showing the average sea-level pressure and the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is plotted on the x-axis, while the average sea-level pressure is plotted on the y-axis. The graph shows that the atmospheric pressure decreases as the altitude increases, while the average sea-level pressure remains relatively constant.
In addition to the main graph, there are two smaller graphs on the right side of the main graph. The first graph shows the average sea-level pressure at different altitudes, while the second graph shows the atmospheric pressure at different sea-level pressures. These smaller graphs provide more detailed information about the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude, as well as the relationship between sea-level pressure and atmospheric pressure.
Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude, as well as the relationship between sea-level pressure and atmospheric pressure.

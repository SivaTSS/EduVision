    "cognitive_comment": "The generated mind map lacks clarity and thematic relevance compared to the ground truth. It mixes definitions, characteristics, and examples without clear separation, making it harder to mentally process the information. The flow of ideas is less coherent, as it jumps between different aspects without a clear structure.",
    "structural_score": 2,
    "structural_comment": "The generated mind map is less well-organized and logically complete than the ground truth. It lacks a consistent hierarchy and does not group related ideas effectively. Key concepts like 'Scientific Theory' and 'Scientific Law' are not as clearly delineated, and the level of detail is inconsistent. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive and logically structured overview of scientific theories."

    "cognitive_comment": "The generated mind map lacks clarity and thematic relevance compared to the ground truth. It introduces new categories like 'Extermination of Snakes' and 'Favorite Reptiles' that are not directly related to the main theme of reptiles' importance, adaptations, and ecological roles. This makes it harder to mentally process the information as a cohesive whole.",

    "structural_comment": "The generated mind map is less well-organized than the ground truth. It introduces new, less relevant categories and lacks a consistent hierarchy. The grouping of ideas is less logical, with some sections like 'Dangerous Snakes as Pets' and 'Favorite Reptiles' not fitting well into the overall structure. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive and logically complete view of the topic."

    Fluid Pressure
      Definition
        Force on Area
        SI Unit: Pascal (Pa)
      Calculation
        Pressure = Force / Area
        Example: Box Pressure
    Fluid Behavior
      Particle Movement
        Constant Motion
        Collisions
      Pressure Distribution
        Equal in All Directions
        Movement from High to Low Pressure
    Factors Influencing Pressure
      Depth of Fluid
        Greater Depth = More Pressure
      Fluid Density
        Denser Fluids = More Pressure
        Comparison: Water vs. Air

    Food Webs
      Definition
        Diagram of feeding interactions
        Multiple intersecting pathways
      Characteristics
        Shows many organisms
        Complex feeding relationships
      Example
        Phytoplankton -> Krill -> Fish -> Shark
    Energy Flow
      Importance
        Constant flow for ecosystem stability
      Mechanism

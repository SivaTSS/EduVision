  Energy Flow in Ecosystems
    Energy Definition
      Ability to change or move matter
      Essential for all living things
    Energy Sources
      Sunlight
      Chemical compounds
    Classification of Living Things
      Based on Energy Acquisition
        Producers
          Definition: Make food for themselves and others
          Types
            Photoautotrophs
              Use sunlight for photosynthesis
              Examples: Plants, algae, some bacteria
            Chemoautotrophs
              Use chemical compounds for chemosynthesis
              Examples: Certain bacteria, archaea
        Consumers
          Definition: Depend on other organisms for food
          Types
            Herbivores
              Consume producers
              Examples: Rabbits, snails
            Carnivores
              Consume animals
              Examples: Lions, frogs
            Omnivores
              Consume both plants and animals
              Examples: Crows, humans
        Decomposers
          Definition: Break down wastes and dead organisms
          Types
            Scavengers
              Consume soft tissues of dead animals
              Examples: Hyenas, cockroaches
            Detritivores
              Consume organic debris
              Examples: Earthworms, catfish
            Saprotrophs
              Feed on remaining organic matter
              Examples: Fungi, protozoa

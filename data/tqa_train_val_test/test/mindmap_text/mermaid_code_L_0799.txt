  Amontons Law
    Definition
      - Increasing temperature increases pressure
      - Constant volume
    Demonstration
      - Air pressure in can
        - Greatest when heated
        - Volume kept constant
        - Pressure lower when cooled
    Applications
      - Sealed jug experiment
        - Higher temperature leads to higher pressure
      - Tire pressure example
        - Friction generates heat
        - Constant volume leads to increased pressure
    Explanation
      - Gas particles move faster when heated
      - More collisions increase pressure
      - Pressure defined as force per area

      Natural vs. Artificial selection
    Natural Selection
      Process
        Adaptation to environment
        Survival of beneficial traits
      Example
        Giraffe neck length
    Artificial Selection
      Definition
        Human-driven breeding
      Example
        Selective breeding of cows

    Reproductive Isolation
      Definition
        Prevents mating between populations
      Types
        Geographic isolation (Allopatric)
        Behavioral isolation (Sympatric)
    Allopatric Speciation
      Definition
        Geographic separation of populations
      Examples
        Darwin's finches on Galapagos Islands
        Squirrels separated by the Grand Canyon
    Sympatric Speciation
      Definition
        Non-geographic separation
      Examples
        Orcas with different hunting behaviors
        Galapagos finches with distinct mating signals

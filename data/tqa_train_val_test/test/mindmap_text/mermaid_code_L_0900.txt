    Importance
      - Learning about the environment
      - Measurements and observations in real-world settings
    Methodology
      - Sample collection

        - Nonpoint-source pollution
          - Example: Runoff rainwater
    Comparison of Samples
      - Nonpoint-source pollution
        - Similar pollutants across samples
      - Point-source pollution
        - Unique pollution in specific sample

  Mass Extinctions
    Definition
      - Extinction of all members of a species
      - Part of natural selection
    Historical Context
      - At least five major mass extinctions in 540 million years
      - Over 50% of animal species died in each
      - Total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20
      - Current potential mass extinction
    Major Extinctions
      - Permian Extinction
        - 99.5% of individual organisms extinct
        - 95% of marine species perished
        - Possible causes: formation of Pangaea
      - Cretaceous Extinction
        - 65 million years ago
        - Extinction of dinosaurs (except ancestors of birds)
        - Possible causes: asteroid/comet collision
          - Effects: tidal waves, climate change, reduced sunlight
          - Evidence: iridium-rich layer in Earth
    Causes of Extinction
      - Environmental changes
      - Lack of necessary survival traits
      - Catastrophic events (volcanic eruptions, earthquakes)
    Aftermath of Extinctions
      - Evolution of new species
      - Filling of habitats left by extinct species

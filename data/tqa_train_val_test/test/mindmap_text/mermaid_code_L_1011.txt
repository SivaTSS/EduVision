    What is an Experiment?
      Definition: Controlled scientific study of variables
      Variables: Factors that can take on different values
    Types of Variables
      Manipulated Variable
        Definition: Changed by the researcher (Independent Variable)
      Responding Variable
        Definition: Predicted to change due to manipulated variable (Dependent Variable)
    Importance of Controlled Variables
      Definition: Variables held constant to avoid influencing outcomes
      Example: Smoothness of ramps in an experiment
    Example Experiment
      Setup: Sliding wooden blocks down ramps
      Manipulated Variable: Steepness of the ramp
      Observations: Effects of ramp smoothness on speed
      Conclusion: Importance of controlling all variables

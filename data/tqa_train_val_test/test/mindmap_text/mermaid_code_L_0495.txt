  Consumers and Decomposers
    Decomposers
      Role in Ecosystem
        Break down dead organisms
        Release nutrients (carbon, nitrogen)
        Recycle nutrients for producers
      Importance
        Stability of ecosystem
        Prevent accumulation of waste
        Support producers' nutrient needs
      Examples
        Bacteria
        Fungi
        Earthworms
        Mushrooms
    Consumers
      Definition
        Obtain energy from other organisms
      Types
        Herbivores

          Eat other animals (e.g., snakes, hawks)
        Omnivores
          Eat both producers and consumers (e.g., humans, dogs)
      Function
        Essential for energy transfer in ecosystems

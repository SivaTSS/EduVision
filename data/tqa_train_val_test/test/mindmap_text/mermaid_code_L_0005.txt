  Erosion and Deposition by Wind
    Wind Erosion
      Definition
        Air movement over Earth's surface
        Causes significant erosion
      Mechanisms
        Abrasion
          Main method of erosion
          Scours and polishes surfaces
        Particle Transport
          Suspension
            Tiny particles (clay, silt)
            Carried high and far
          Saltation
            Larger particles (sand)
            Moves in short hops close to ground
          Traction
            Largest particles (pebbles)
            Rolled or pushed along surface
    Sediments Deposited by Wind
      Sand Dunes
        Formation
          Requires sand and wind
          Starts with an obstacle
        Migration
          Movement due to saltation
          Direction follows prevailing wind
      Loess
        Definition
          Deposits of silt and clay
          Forms vertical cliffs
        Agricultural Importance
          Rich soil for farming
    Prevention of Wind Erosion
      Ground Cover
        Importance of plants
        Helps retain soil and water
      Barriers
        Rows of trees
          Slow down wind
        Fences
          Prevent erosion and dune migration
    Dust Storms
      Conditions
        Common in dry climates
        Dry, bare soil more susceptible

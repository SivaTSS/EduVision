  Structural Evidence for Evolution
    Vestigial Structures
      Definition
        Structures that have lost their use
      Examples
        Flightless Cormorant
          Vestigial trait: wings
          Compensation: adapted for swimming
        Penguins
          Flippers for swimming, not flying
        Whales
          Pelvic bones from land-dwelling ancestors
    Homologous Structures
      Definition
        Structures with common function
      Examples
        Mammal limbs
          Bats, lions, whales, humans
          Common ancestor
    Embryology
      Definition
        Study of organism development
      Evidence
        Similarities in embryos
          Gill slits in human embryos
          Suggests common ancestry with fish
        Common ancestors
          Humans and chimpanzees
          Different evolutionary paths

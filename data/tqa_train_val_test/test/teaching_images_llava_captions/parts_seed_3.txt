In the image, there is a close-up view of a bean pod with a bean inside. The bean pod is labeled with the names of the different parts of the bean, such as the cotyledon, hypocotyl, radicle, and cotyledon. The cotyledon is the part of the bean that contains the embryo, while the hypocotyl is the part of the bean that emerges from the cotyledon. The radicle is the part of the bean that emerges from the cotyledon and eventually grows into the root, and the cotyledon is the part of the bean that eventually grows into the stem.

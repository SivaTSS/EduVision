The image displays a cross-section of a leaf, showcasing its internal structure. The leaf is divided into several sections, including the epidermis, mesophyll, palisade mesophyll, and lower epidermis. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the leaf, while the mesophyll is the layer of tissue beneath the epidermis. The palisade mesophyll is the middle layer of the leaf, responsible for photosynthesis, and the lower epidermis is the innermost layer of the leaf.
In addition to the leaf cross-section, there is a potted plant in the background, providing a sense of scale and context for the image.

The upper epidermis is the outermost layer of the cell, while the lower epidermis is the innermost layer. The mesophyll is the middle layer of the cell, and the cell wall is the structure that holds the cell together.
In addition to these layers, the cell also contains a vascular bundle and a sheath. The vascular bundle is responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen throughout the cell, while the sheath is a protective layer that surrounds the vascular bundle.
Overall, the image provides a detailed view of the various components that make up a cell, highlighting the importance of each layer in maintaining the cell's structure and function.

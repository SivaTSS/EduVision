In the image, there is a mountain with a cloud hovering above it. The cloud appears to be a rain shadow region, which is an area where the sun's rays are blocked by the mountain, causing rain to fall on the opposite side of the mountain. The diagram illustrates the process of condensing water vapor in the cloud, which eventually falls as rain on the other side of the mountain.
The diagram also shows the temperature and humidity of the air at different altitudes on the mountain. The temperature decreases as the altitude increases, while the humidity remains relatively constant until it reaches the rain shadow region. In the rain shadow region, the humidity drops significantly as the air cools down due to the blocking of the sun's rays.
Overall, the image and the accompanying diagram provide a visual representation of the process of condensing water vapor in clouds and the formation of rain shadow regions.

In the image, there is a close-up view of a leaf with its parts labeled. The leaf is composed of several parts, including the petiole, which is the stalk that connects the leaf to the stem, and the vein, which is the central tube that carries water and nutrients throughout the leaf. The leaf also has a stipule, which is a small leaf-like structure found at the base of the petiole, and a lamina, which is the flat green surface of the leaf. Additionally, the leaf has a midrib, which is the central vein that runs through the leaf, and a lateral vein, which is a smaller vein that branches off from the midrib.

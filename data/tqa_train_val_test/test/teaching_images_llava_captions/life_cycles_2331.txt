In the image, there is a life cycle of a frog displayed in a circle. The circle is divided into four sections, each representing a different stage of the frog's life. The first section shows the frog as an egg, the second section displays the frog as a tadpole, the third section shows the frog as an adult, and the fourth section shows the frog laying eggs.
In addition to the frog's life cycle, there is a picture of a frog on the left side of the circle, and a picture of a frog on the right side of the circle. The frog on the left side is in the tadpole stage, while the frog on the right side is in the adult stage.

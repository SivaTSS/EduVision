  Global Wind Belts
    Definition
      Winds blow from high to low pressure
      Winds at base of atmospheric circulation cells
    Northern Hemisphere Wind Belts
      Hadley Cell
        Air moves northeast to southwest
        Trade Winds
      Ferrel Cell
        Air moves southwest
        Westerly Winds
      Polar Cell
        Air moves northeast
        Polar Easterlies
    Southern Hemisphere Wind Belts
      Similar to Northern Hemisphere
    Jet Stream
      Definition
        Fast-flowing river of air
        Forms at boundary between troposphere and stratosphere
      Polar Jet Stream
        Forms at polar front
        Most powerful jet stream
        Moves seasonally
    Precipitation and Evaporation
      Precipitation in low pressure regions
      Evaporation in high pressure regions
    Polar Front
      Junction between Ferrell and Polar cells
      Extreme weather
    Climate Influence
      High and low pressure areas determine climate
      Precipitation and evaporation patterns

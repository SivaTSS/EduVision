  Punnett Squares
    Definition
      Tool for predicting offspring from a cross
      Based on laws of probability
    Steps to Create
      1. Parent factors at top
      2. Parent factors on left
      3. Pull factors into boxes
    Example
      Cross between purple flowers (Bb)
    Calculating Percentage
      Offspring with certain trait
      Dominant trait = 25%
    Crosses
      1. Aa x Aa
         Genotype ratio: 1:1
         Phenotype ratio: 3:1
      2. AABb x Aabb
         Genotype ratio: 1:1:1:1
         Phenotype ratio: 1:1:1:1
      3. AAbb x aabb
         Genotype ratio: 1:1:1:1
         Phenotype ratio: 3:1
    Applications
      Peas (yellow vs green seeds)
      Guinea pigs (smooth vs rough coat)
    Mendel's Rules of Heredity
      Law of Segregation
        Each parent contributes one factor
      Law of Independent Assortment
        Factors assort independently

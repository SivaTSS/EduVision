  Air Masses
    Definition
      Batch of air with same temp and humidity
      Forms over stable regions
    Formation
      High pressure zones
      Polar and tropical regions
    Types
      Continental (c)
        Forms over land
        Dry and cold
      Maritime (m)
        Forms over water
        Moist and warm
      Polar (P)
        Forms near poles
        Cold and dry
      Tropical (T)
        Forms near equator
        Moist and warm
    Movement
      Pushed by high-level winds
      Shares temp and humidity with regions
    Interaction
      Storms form when air mass and region have different characteristics
      Cold air over warm ground causes heating and cloud formation
      Warm air over cold ground causes cooling and inversion
    Size
      Can be 1,600 km across
      Several kilometers thick
    Moderation of Temperature
      Movements moderate temperature
    Relationship with Storms
      Form mostly in high pressure areas
      Storms arise if air mass and region have different characteristics

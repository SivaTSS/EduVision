  Gregor Mendel
    Monk
    Austrian
    Mid-1800s
    Studied heredity in pea plants
  Pea Plants
    Easy to grow
    Quick growth
    Many observable traits
    Two forms of each trait
    Sexual reproduction
      Pollination
      Fertilization
  Mendel's Experiments
    One trait at a time
      Law of Segregation
    Two traits at a time
      Law of Independent Assortment
  Law of Segregation
    Two factors control each trait
    Dominant factor hides recessive factor
    Factors separate in gametes
  Law of Independent Assortment
    Factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently
    F2 plants have all possible combinations of traits
  Mendel's Legacy
    Father of Genetics
    Science of Heredity
    Discoveries ignored until 1900
    Modern Genetics based on Mendel's work

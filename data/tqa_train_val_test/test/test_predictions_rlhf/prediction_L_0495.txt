  Consumers and Decomposers
    Consumers
      Definition
        Obtain nutrients and energy by eating other organisms
      Types of Consumers
        Herbivores
          Eat producers (plants)
        Carnivores
          Eat animals (herbivores or other carnivores)
        Omnivores
          Eat both producers and animals
    Decomposers
      Definition
        Break down dead organisms and wastes to get energy
      Importance
        Release nutrients back into the environment
        Stability of ecosystem depends on decomposers
    Examples of Consumers
      Caterpillars (herbivores)
      Hawks (carnivores)
      Dogs, bears, raccoons (omnivores)
    Examples of Decomposers
      Mushrooms on decaying log
      Bacteria in soil
    Role of Decomposers in Ecosystem
      Recycle nutrients back into ecosystem
      Allow producers to use nutrients
      Essential for ecosystem stability and survival

    Water Pressure Changes
      Increases with Depth
        Each Meter: 10 kPa
        At 30 Meters: Double Surface Pressure
        At 500 Meters: Too Great for Humans
        At 11,000 Meters: Tremendous Pressure

    Pressure Explanation
      Definition: Force per Area
      Increases with Depth
        More Water Above
        Greater Pressure
    Dangers of Rapid Ascent
      Dissolved Gases Form Bubbles
        Less Gas Dissolves at Lower Pressure
        Causes Health Problems

  Mendel's Laws and Genetics
    Mendel's Experiment
      Dominant vs Recessive Traits
        Dominant Trait
        Recessive Trait
      Law of Segregation
        Hereditary Factors
          Two Possibilities
          Dominant Masks Recessive
        Segregation During Gamete Production
          One Factor per Gamete
          Offspring Receive Two Factors
    Mendel's Crosses
      Tall vs Short Plants
        F1 Generation
          All Tall Plants
        F2 Generation
          Four Possible Combinations
          Probability of Short Plants
    Implications of Mendel's Laws
      No Blending of Traits
      Development of Theory
        Law of Segregation
        Understanding of DNA
      Remarkable Achievement
        Without Knowledge of DNA
        Predates Understanding of Meiosis

      Egg-laying
      Leathery eggs
      Similar to reptiles and birds
    Marsupials
      Live young born immature
      Development in pouch
      Examples: kangaroos, koalas, opossums
    Placental Mammals
      Live young born mature
      Development in womb
      Placenta allows nutrient exchange
    Mating Systems
      Seal species: many females, one male
      Elephant seals: males larger than females
      Sexual dimorphism: differences between sexes
    Reproductive Strategies
      Monotremes: egg-laying
      Marsupials: pouch development
      Placental mammals: placenta development
    Evolutionary Relationships
      Monotremes more like reptiles and birds
      Marsupials and placental mammals distinct
    Marsupial Reproduction Process
      Parental care differences
      Licking during birth
      Finding the pouch
    Creation of Placenta
      Purposes: nutrient exchange, waste removal
      Umbilical cord function

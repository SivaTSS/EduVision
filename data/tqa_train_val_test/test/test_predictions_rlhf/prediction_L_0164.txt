  Extinction and Radiation of Life
    Definition of Extinction
      Normal part of Earth's history
      Two ways to go extinct: die out or evolve into a different species
    Mass Extinctions
      Causes: comet/asteroid collisions, massive volcanic eruptions, rapidly changing climate
      Many species go extinct in a short amount of time
    Adaptive Radiation
      New habitats become available
      Species evolve to fill them
      Biodiversity increases
    Speciation
      One species evolves into two different species
      Necessary for adaptive radiation
    Examples of Adaptive Radiation
      Three-spined sticklebacks at Loberg Lake in Alaska
      Honeycreepers in Hawaii
    Extinction Rates
      Most species that have lived have gone extinct
      Many mass extinctions identified
    Mass Extinctions
      Large numbers of species go extinct in a short amount of time
    K-T (Cretaceous-Tertiary) Boundary
      Mass extinction event
      Causes: comet/asteroid collision, massive volcanic eruptions, rapidly changing climate
    Fossils at the K-T Boundary
      Evidence of mass extinction
      Tyrannosaurus rex foss

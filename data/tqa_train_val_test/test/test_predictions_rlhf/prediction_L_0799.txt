  Amontons Law
    Definition
      Increasing temperature of a gas while holding its volume constant increases its pressure
    Explanation
      Heating gas particles move faster
        Increases collisions with each other and container
        Causes greater pressure
    Demonstration
      Air pressure in a can
        Constant volume after heating
        Lower pressure after cooling
    Application
      Friction between tires and road
        Generates heat
        Increases tire pressure
      Amontons Gas Law
        Relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas
        First proposed by Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s
        One of three commonly known gas laws
        Explains difference in air pressure in a tire
          Tire and air inside it get warmer due to friction with the road
          Volume of air inside the tire is constant
          Pressure of the air increases when it gets warmer

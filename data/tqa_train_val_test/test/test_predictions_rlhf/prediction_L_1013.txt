      Definition
        Drawing general conclusions based on many pieces of evidence
      Uses in Science
        Drawing general conclusions from evidence
        Changing conclusions based on new evidence
      Limitations
        Cannot prove conclusively that an idea is true
        May lead to conclusions that are very likely to be true
    Crime Solving
      Example
        Detective gathers clues to solve crime
    Scientific Method
      Basis
        Inductive Reasoning
    Example: Gravity
      Observation
        Objects fall to the ground
      Conclusion
        All objects fall to the ground
      Revised Conclusion
        Objects heavier than air fall to the ground
        Objects lighter than air do not fall to the ground
    Reasonable Doubt
      Jurors in a trial
        Decide guilt without a reasonable doubt
      Scientific Theories
        Never proven conclusively to be true
        Supported by so much evidence that it is accepted without a reasonable doubt

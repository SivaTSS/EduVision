    Definition
      Systematic approach to answer questions about natural world
    Steps
      Ask Question
        Based on observations or data
      Background Research
        Understand question and context
      Create Hypothesis
        Predict outcome of experiment
      Experiment or Observation
        Test hypothesis
      Gather Data
        Collect results
      Formulate Conclusion
        Analyze data and draw conclusions
    Characteristics of Scientific Questions

    Definition
      Growth towards or away from a stimulus
    Types
      Phototropism
        Stimulus: Light
        Response: Growth towards light
        Example: Leaves and stems grow towards light
      Gravitropism
        Stimulus: Gravity
        Response: Growth towards or away from gravity
        Example: Roots grow downwards, shoots grow upwards
      Thigmotropism
        Stimulus: Touch
        Response: Growth towards or away from touch
        Example: Tendrils twist around poles
    Auxins
      Hormone causing tropisms
      Rapid cell growth on one side of stem
      Causes bending of plant
    Phototropic Response
      Determined by growing tip of plant
      Migration up and down plant shoot
      Agar block experiment
    Experiment
      Agar block placed in light
      Plant stem placed on agar block
      Stem bends towards light
    Conclusion
      Auxin causes phototropic response
      Auxin moves to one side of stem
      Rapid cell growth on one side of stem
      Stem bends towards light

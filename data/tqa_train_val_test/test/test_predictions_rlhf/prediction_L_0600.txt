  Evolution
    Microevolution
      Definition
        Small changes over time
      Examples
        Mosquitoes resistant to pesticides
      Characteristics
        Changes within a species
        No new species created
    Macroevolution
      Definition
        Large evolutionary changes
      Examples
        New species creation
      Characteristics
        Repeated microevolution over time
        Major environmental changes
    Cambrian Explosion
      Definition
        Rapid evolutionary change
      Timing
        Occurred 540 million years ago
      Impact
        Created new species
    Species
      Definition
        Group of organisms with similar characteristics
      Identification
        Ability to mate and produce fertile offspring
    Population
      Definition
        Group of organisms of the same species in the same area
    Microevolution vs. Macroevolution
      Differences
        Microevolution: small changes, no new species
        Macroevolution: large changes, new species
      Relationship
        Microevolution leads to macroevolution over time
    Phyletic Gradualism
      Definition
        Gradual evolutionary change
    Punctuated Equilibrium
      Definition
        Rapid evolutionary change followed by long periods of stability
    Evolutionary Changes
      Small vs. Large
        Both possible

  Hypothesis Testing
    Observations vs. Experiments
      Observations: Simple Measurements or Advanced Technology
      Experiments: Controlled Conditions and Manipulation of One Variable
    Circumstances for Each
      Observations: Practical or Ethical Reasons
      Experiments: Verification or Falsification of Hypothesis

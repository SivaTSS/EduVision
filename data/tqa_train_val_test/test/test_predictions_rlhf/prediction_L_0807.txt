  Bernoulli's Law
    Definition
      - Fluid pressure decreases with increased speed
      - Named after Daniel Bernoulli
    Explanation
      - Pressure is force per unit area
      - Bernoulli used mathematics to discover law
    Application
      - Wings of airplanes and birds
        - Lift created by difference in air pressure
      - Racecar spoilers
        - Upside-down wing shape causes air pressure push downward
    Implications
      - Lift allows flight
      - Spoilers help cars stay on track

  Development of Theories
    Scientific Theory
      Explanation of complex phenomena
      Provides why something happens
      Used to predict future events
      Strongly supported by evidence
      No major inconsistencies
      Constantly tested and revised
      Simpler model of reality
      Reliable explanations and predictions
      Can be revised or discarded
    Scientific Law
      Describes something that always happens
      Under the same set of circumstances
      Does not explain why it happens
      May have exceptions
      Not always applicable
    Hypothesis, Theory, and Law
      Hypothesis: tentative explanation
      Theory: strongly supported explanation
      Law: always applicable description
    Importance in Science
      Hypothesis: initial step in scientific inquiry
      Theory: foundation of scientific understanding
      Law: useful for predicting and explaining phenomena
    Evidence and Testing
      Evidence supports or refutes a hypothesis
      No significant evidence to refute = accepted
      Becomes a theory with strong evidence
      Continuous testing and revision
    Relationship Between Theories and Laws
      Theories provide explanations for laws
      Laws are part of theories
      Laws can be exceptions to theories
    Misconceptions
      Theory is not a proven fact
      Law is not always applicable
      Science does not

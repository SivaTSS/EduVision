  Charles Law
    Definition
      - Scientific law about gases
      - Increasing temperature increases volume (constant pressure)
    History
      - Developed by Jacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussac
      - Based on experiments in the early 1800s
    Explanation
      - Heating a gas gives particles more energy
      - Speedy particles spread out, increasing volume
    Application
      - Hot air balloons
      - Gas expansion in engines
    Implications
      - Understanding gas behavior
      - Predicting gas behavior in various conditions

  Human Vision
    Definition
      Ability to see light
      Depends on eyes detecting light and forming images
      Brain interpreting images
    Importance
      Primates rely on vision more than other animals
      Humans can see in 3D and color
    Eye Components
      Cornea
        Protective layer
        Refracts light
      Pupil
        Adjusts size to control light
      Retina
        Contains two main cells
          Rods
            Sensitive to light
            Detect black and white
          Cones
            Sensitive to color
            Detect detail
    Depth Perception
      Two eyes facing same direction
      Slightly different angles
      Brain interprets differences
    Color Vision
      Humans see in color
      Other animals see in shades of gray
      Bees and butterflies see ultraviolet patterns
    Evolutionary Advantage
      Primates evolved depth perception
        Helped tree-dwelling primates survive
      Primates evolved color vision
        Helped fruit-eating primates find food
    Raptors Night Vision
      Can see up to 8 times better than humans
      Can see a rabbit from a mile away
    Adaptation
      Depth perception and color vision helped early primates survive
      Humans have better

  Ecological Succession
    Definition
      Constant replacement of one community by another
    Types of Succession
      Primary Succession
        Occurs in areas with no soil
        Begins with pioneer species (e.g., lichens)
        Soil formation through pioneer species
      Secondary Succession
        Occurs in established areas disturbed
        Pioneer species are grasses or shrubs
        Soil already exists
    Stages of Succession
      Early Succession
        Grasses and shrubs dominate
        Soil improvement
      Later Succession
        Trees begin to grow
        Forest establishment
    Climax Communities
      End result of succession
      Stable balance of organisms
      Dependent on climate
    Sub-Climax Communities
      Maintained by human activities
      Example: American Prairie
    Impact of Human Activities
      Cattle grazing affecting sagebrush and grasses
      Fire aiding spread of American Prairie
    Biomes and Climax Communities
      Relationship between the two
      Factors affecting characteristics of climax communities
    Questions
      How do climax communities relate to biomes?
      What factors affect the characteristics of climax communities?
      How has cattle grazing affected the ecological balance between sagebrush and grass

  Pascals Law
    Definition
      Change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid
      Transmitted equally throughout the fluid
    Examples
      Toothpaste tube
        Squeezing tube forces toothpaste out
      Hydraulic brakes
        Pressure transmitted to brake shoes
        Increases force applied to brake shoes
      Hydraulic car lifts
        Raises heavy cars for mechanics
        Increases force applied to lift
    Pressure
      Definition
        Force acting on a given area
      Equation
        Pressure = Force / Area
        Force = Pressure * Area
    Pascal's Contributions
      Blaise Pascal
        French mathematician and physicist
        SI unit of pressure named after him
      Pascals Law
        Change in pressure transmitted equally
        Useful in various applications
        Toothpaste tube

        Hydraulic brakes
          Pressure transmitted to brake shoes
          Increases force applied to brake shoes
        Hydraulic car lifts
          Raises heavy cars for mechanics
          Increases force applied to lift

  Molecular Evidence for Evolution
    Molecular Clocks
      Determine relationships between species
      Calculate number of differences between DNA or amino acid sequences
      Fewer differences = less time since species split
    Genomes
      All of the genes in an organism
      Comparison of genomes provides new information about relationships and evolution
    Biochemical Building Blocks
      Same building blocks in all organisms
      Amino acids and nucleotides
    DNA and RNA Determine Development
      Determine development of all organisms
    Similarities and Differences in Genomes
      Confirm patterns of evolution
    Examples
      Chicken and gorilla have more differences than gorilla and orangutan
      Whale and horse have more DNA sequences in common than whale and shark
      Mammal and bird have more differences than mammal and frog
      Mammal and fish have more differences than mammal and bird

  Food Webs
    Definition
      Food Chain
        Single pathway of feeding interactions
        Arrows show feeding relationships
        Energy flow from one organism to another
      Food Web
        Multiple intersecting pathways
        More complex than food chains
        Energy flow through ecosystem
    Importance
      Energy Flow
        Organisms must eat other organisms
        Stable ecosystems require constant energy flow
      Food Chain Levels
        Producers
          Beginning of food chain
          Create energy through photosynthesis
        Consumers
          Herbivores, carnivores
          Use glucose for energy
        Decomposers
          Not included in food chains
          Break down dead organisms
    Examples
      Arctic Ocean Food Web
        Loons and Arctic Terns
          Common species
        Beluga and Sea Ducks
          Common food source
        Zooplankton Feeders
          Various species
    Building a Food Web
      Healthy Food Web Requirements
        Multiple feeding relationships
        Energy flow from producers to consumers
      Food Chain vs Food Web
        Food Chain: Single pathway
        Food Web: Multiple intersecting pathways

  Natural Selection
    Definition
      Process by which organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers
    Evolution
      Occurs by natural selection
      Inherited traits change over time
    Sources of Variation
      Within a population
      Genetic mutations
      Recombination in sexually reproducing organisms
    Adaptation
      Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment
    Natural Selection Process
      1. Variation in inherited traits
      2. Some traits give individuals an advantage
      3. Individuals with advantageous traits have more offspring
    Importance of Natural Selection
      Ensures survival of species
      Allows for adaptation to changing environments
    Examples of Natural Selection
      Arctic hares and white fur
      Giant tortoises and neck length
      Human earlobes and attachment
    Number of Species
      Between 5 million and 30 million on the planet
    Adaptation and Diversity
      Increases chance of survival in changing environments
      Example: small organisms surviving after large organisms die
    Conclusion
      Natural selection is key to understanding evolution and adaptation in species

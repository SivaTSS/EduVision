      Soil
      Water
      Minerals
    Biotic Factors
      Species
        Unique type of organism
        Members can interbreed
      Population
        Members of a species living in the same area
      Community

    Producers
      Make food using energy
        Photosynthesis
          Plants and algae
        Chemosynthesis
          Microbes
    Consumers
      Can't make their own food
      Types
        Grazers
        Predators

    Energy Flow
      Most ecosystems get energy from the Sun
      Producers convert sunlight to chemical energy
      Consumers get some energy when they eat producers
    Food Chains
      Simple diagram of energy flow
      Producers at base

          Pioneer Species
            Bacteria

          Soil Formation
            Weathering of rock
            Addition of organic matter
        Secondary Succession
          Occurs in disturbed areas
          Pioneer Species
            Grasses
            Fireweed
          Faster than primary succession

      Definition
        Final stable state of an ecosystem
      Likelihood
        Unlikely due to frequent disturbances
    Human Impact
      Environmental Problems
        Caused by human actions
      Effects on Living Things
        Impact on ecosystems and species
    Comparison

        Primary: bare rock, slower
        Secondary: disturbed area, faster

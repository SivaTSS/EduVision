  Mendel's Discoveries
    Gregor Mendel
      Austrian monk
      Studied heredity in pea plants
      Traits passed from parents to offspring
    Pea Plants
      Easy to grow
      Quick growth
      Observable traits
        Flower color
        Stem length
    Mendel's Experiments
      One trait at a time
        Law of Segregation
          Factors separate into gametes
          Dominant and recessive traits
      Two traits at a time
        Law of Independent Assortment
          Factors for different traits assort independently
    Scientific Legacy
      Father of Genetics
      Work ignored until 1900
      Basis of modern genetics

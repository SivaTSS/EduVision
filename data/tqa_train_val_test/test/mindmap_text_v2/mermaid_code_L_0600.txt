  Microevolution and Macroevolution
    Microevolution
      Definition
        Small changes in organisms over time
      Factors
        Natural selection
        Genetic drift
        Gene flow
        Mutation
      Examples
        Pesticide-resistant mosquitoes
      Outcomes
        Changes within a species
        Does not create new species
    Macroevolution
      Definition
        Larger evolutionary changes resulting in new species
      Causes
        Repeated microevolution over time
        Major environmental changes
      Examples
        Darwin's finches
      Concepts
        Phyletic gradualism
        Punctuated equilibrium
    Cambrian Explosion
      Definition
        Rapid diversification of life forms
      Timing
        Occurred during the Cambrian Period
      Relation to Evolution
        Represents macroevolution
      Causes
        Various hypotheses about environmental factors
      Fossil Comparison
        Similarity between current and Cambrian body plans

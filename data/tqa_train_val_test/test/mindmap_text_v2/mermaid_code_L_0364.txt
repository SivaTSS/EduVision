    Description
      Multicellular eukaryotes
      Cell walls of cellulose
      Chloroplasts for photosynthesis
    Importance
      Food source for organisms
      Oxygen production
      Carbon dioxide absorption
      Recycling matter in ecosystems
      Products for human use
    Plant Tissues
      Dermal Tissue
        Covers outside of plant
        Secretes cuticle
      Ground Tissue
        Makes up inside of plant
        Stores food and water
      Vascular Tissue
        Transports fluids
        Xylem and Phloem
    Plant Organs
      Roots
        Absorb water and minerals
        Anchor and support plant
        Store food
      Stems
        Hold plants upright
        Transport water and nutrients
        Bear leaves and flowers
      Leaves
        Collect sunlight
        Photosynthesis
        Varied structure for environment
    Growth
      Cell growth and division
      Meristem tissue
        Primary growth
        Secondary growth
    Life Cycle
      Alternation of generations
        Haploid (gametophyte)
        Diploid (sporophyte)
      Dominant generation
        Most modern plants are sporophytes

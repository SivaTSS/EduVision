  Climate Influence
    Maritime Climate
      Definition
        Influenced by nearby ocean
        Less extreme temperatures
      Characteristics
        Small seasonal and daily temperature variation
        Winds predominantly from the sea
      Examples
        San Francisco
          Influenced by California Current
          Affected by coastal upwelling
    Continental Climate
      Definition
        Influenced by nearby land
        More extreme temperatures
      Characteristics
        Greater temperature differences
        Winds predominantly from the continent
      Examples
        Wichita
          More extreme continental climate
        Virginia Beach
          Near Atlantic Ocean
          Less ocean influence than San Francisco
    Ocean Influence

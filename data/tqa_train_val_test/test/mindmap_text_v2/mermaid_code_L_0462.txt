  Biotechnology in Agriculture
    Food Chain
      Definition
        Diagram of feeding interactions
        Single pathway
      Characteristics
        Begins with producers
        Limited levels (3-4)
        Example: plant -> grasshopper -> bird -> snake -> owl
    Food Web
      Definition
        Diagram of feeding interactions
        Multiple intersecting pathways
      Characteristics
        Shows many organisms
        More complex than food chains
        Example: phytoplankton -> krill -> fish -> shark
    Energy Flow
      Importance
        Constant flow for stability
        Organisms must eat others
      Representation
        Arrows indicate feeding relationships
    Producers and Consumers
      Producers
        Create own food through photosynthesis
        Start of food chain
      Consumers
        Herbivores and carnivores
        Use glucose for energy
    Decomposers
      Role in food chains
        Break down organic matter
        Important for nutrient cycling
    Healthy Food Web
      Requirements
        Diversity of species
        Balanced interactions
      Construction
        Must include various trophic levels

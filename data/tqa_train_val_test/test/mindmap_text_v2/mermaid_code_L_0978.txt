  Pascals Law
    Definition
      States that change in pressure in enclosed fluid is transmitted equally
    Applications
      Ketchup Packet
        Tearing hole causes fluid to squirt out
        Pressure transmitted equally throughout fluid
      Toothpaste Tube
        Squeezing tube forces toothpaste out
        Pressure applied is transmitted equally
      Hydraulic Brakes
        Use fluid to transmit pressure
        Increases force applied to brake shoes
      Hydraulic Car Lifts
        Raise heavy cars using fluid pressure
      Airplane Controls
        Use fluids to transmit pressure for landing gear
    Pressure Concept
      Definition
        Amount of force acting on a given area
      Equation
        Pressure = Force / Area
        Force = Pressure * Area
      Effects
        More force increases pressure
        Same force over smaller area increases pressure
    Historical Context
      Blaise Pascal
        French mathematician and physicist
        SI unit of pressure named after him

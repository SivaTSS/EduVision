  Plants Evolution and Classification
    First Plants
      Evolved from aquatic green algae
      Lacked true stems, roots, and leaves
      Male and female reproductive organs
    Colonization of Land
      First living things to move from water to land
      Faced dryness and strong solar radiation
    Early Evolution of Vascular Plants
      Vascular tissue as major adaptation
      True stems, roots, and leaves evolved
    Importance of Seed Evolution
      Freed plants from needing water to reproduce
      Early seed plants produced naked seeds in cones
    Success of Flowering Plants
      Flowers evolved for seed production
      Attract pollinators for reproduction
    Classification of Modern Plants
      Nonvascular vs. Vascular
        Nonvascular: Bryophytes (liverworts, hornworts, mosses)
        Vascular: Tracheophytes (seedless and seed plants)
          Seedless: Ferns
          Seed Plants: Spermatophytes
            Gymnosperms: Naked seeds in cones
            Angiosperms: Seeds in ovaries of flowers
    Adaptations for Life on Land
      Vascular tissue as "plumbing system"
      True leaves and roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption
      Dominant sporophyte generation for genetic backup
    Reproductive Structures
      Seeds: Embryo and food supply (endosperm)
      Ovules and pollen for fertilization
      Pollen tubes for sperm transfer
    Role of Pollinators
      Animals that carry pollen for reproduction
      Importance of showy petals to attract pollinators

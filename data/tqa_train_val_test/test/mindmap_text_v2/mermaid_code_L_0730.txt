  Pressure of Fluids
    Definition
      Pressure = Force / Area
      SI Unit: Pascal (Pa)
    Factors Affecting Pressure
      Depth
      Density
    Pascal's Law
      Change in pressure transmitted equally
      Example: Toothpaste tube
      Application: Hydraulic systems
    Bernoulli's Law
      Pressure in moving fluid is less when moving faster
      Application: Lift in airplanes and birds
    Pressure Calculation
      Example: Box on ground
      Example: Break dancer's pressure
    Fluid Behavior
      Particles moving randomly
      Pressure exerted in all directions
    Real-world Applications
      Bicycle pump
      Air pressure in tires
      Effects of altitude on air pressure

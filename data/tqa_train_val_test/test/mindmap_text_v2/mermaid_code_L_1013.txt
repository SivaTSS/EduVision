  Inductive Reasoning
    What is inductive reasoning?
      Definition: Drawing general conclusions from evidence
      Basis of scientific method
    Use in Science
      Drawing conclusions from evidence
      Conclusions may change with new evidence
      Cannot prove ideas conclusively
    Example: Rayna's Rat Study
      Observed preference for brand A over brand B
      Conclusion: Not all rats can be generalized
      Reason: Sample size and variability
    Crime Solving
      Use of clues to identify suspects
      Gathering evidence to draw conclusions
    Example: Planet Quim
      Observations of falling objects on Earth
      Initial conclusion: All objects fall
      Additional evidence: Balloons rising
      Revised conclusion: Heavier objects fall, lighter objects rise
    Limitations of Inductive Reasoning
      No 100% certainty in conclusions
      Possibility of undiscovered evidence
      Jurors' decision: Beyond reasonable doubt
      Scientific theories: Supported by evidence, not conclusively proven

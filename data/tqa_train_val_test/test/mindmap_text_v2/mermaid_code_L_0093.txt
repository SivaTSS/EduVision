  Air Masses
    Definition
      Batch of air with similar temperature and humidity
      Acquires characteristics from source region
    Formation
      High pressure areas
      Stable regions for extended periods
      Size can be 1,600 km across and several kilometers thick
    Types
      Continental
        Forms over land
        Characteristics vary by region
      Maritime
        Forms over water
        Characteristics vary by region
      Polar
        Forms in polar regions
        Generally cold
      Tropical
        Forms in tropical regions
        Generally warm
    Movement
      Pushed by high-level winds
      Shares temperature and humidity with new regions
    Weather Impact
      Interaction with different air masses can cause storms
      Cold air over warm ground can create clouds and thunderstorms
      Warm air over cold ground can create inversions
    Temperature Moderation
      Cold air moves toward the Equator
      Warm air moves toward the poles
      Balances planetary temperatures

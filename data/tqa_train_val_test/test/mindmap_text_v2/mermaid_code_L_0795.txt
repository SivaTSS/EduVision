  Air Pressure and Altitude
    Changes in Air Pressure
      Greatest at Sea Level
      Decreases with Altitude
    Factors Affecting Air Pressure
      Density of Atmosphere
        Gas Molecules Pulled by Gravity
        More Collisions = Greater Pressure
      Depth of Atmosphere
        Greatest at Sea Level
        Decreases with Altitude
    Breathing and Air Pressure
      Mechanism of Breathing
        Lower Pressure in Straw
        Fluid Flows from High to Low Pressure

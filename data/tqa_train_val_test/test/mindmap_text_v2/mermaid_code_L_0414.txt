  Energy Flow in Ecosystems
    Energy Definition
      Ability to change or move matter
      Essential for all living things
    Energy Sources
      Sunlight
      Chemical compounds
    Classification of Living Things
      Producers
        Autotrophs
          Photoautotrophs
            Use sunlight
            Examples: plants, algae, bacteria
          Chemoautotrophs
            Use chemical compounds
            Examples: certain bacteria, archaea
      Consumers
        Heterotrophs
          Herbivores
            Examples: rabbits, snails
          Carnivores
            Examples: lions, frogs
          Omnivores
            Examples: crows, humans
      Decomposers
        Break down organic matter
        Types
          Scavengers
            Examples: hyenas, cockroaches
          Detritivores
            Examples: earthworms, catfish
          Saprotrophs
            Examples: fungi, protozoa
    Energy Flow Models
      Food Chains
        Single pathway
        Simpler than actual relationships
      Food Webs
        Multiple pathways
        More complex representation
    Trophic Levels
      Definition
        Feeding position in food chain/web
      Levels
        Level 1: Producers
        Level 2: Primary consumers
        Level 3: Secondary consumers
        Level 4: Tertiary consumers
      Energy Transfer
        10% energy transfer to next level
        90% used for metabolic processes or lost as heat
    Biomass
      Total mass of organisms at a trophic level
      Fewer organisms at higher levels
      Larger size at higher trophic levels

  Competition
    Types of Competition
      Intraspecific Competition
        Same species compete for resources
        Example: Trees competing for light
      Interspecific Competition
        Different species compete for resources
        Example: Cheetahs and lions competing for prey
    Competitive Exclusion Principle
      Less suited species adapt, move, or die out
    Character Displacement
      Species develop different specializations
      Example: Darwin's Finches with different bill types
    Role in Evolution
      Competition influences natural selection
      Better adapted organisms survive and reproduce
    Resource Availability
      Limited resources necessary for competition
      Types of resources: food, water, light, space

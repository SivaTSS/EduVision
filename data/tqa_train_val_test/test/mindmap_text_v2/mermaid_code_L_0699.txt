  Tropisms
    Definition
      Growth toward or away from a stimulus
    Types
      Phototropism
        Stimulus: Light
        Response: Leaves and stems grow toward light
      Gravitropism
        Stimulus: Gravity
        Response: Roots grow downward, shoots grow upward
      Thigmotropism
        Stimulus: Touch
        Response: Tendrils twist around objects
    Mechanism
      Auxins
        Hormones that cause directional growth
        Move to one side of the stem
        Cause rapid cell growth on one side
        Result in bending of the plant
    Experiments
      Phototropism Signal
        Occurs in growing tip of plant
      Signal Migration
        Moves up and down, not across
      Agar Block Experiment
        Demonstrated substance responsible for response
    Importance
      Adaptation to environment
      Maximizing light for photosynthesis
      Roots obtaining water and nutrients

  Mass Extinctions
    Definition
      Extinction of all members of a species
      Part of natural selection
    Major Mass Extinctions
      At least five in the last 540 million years
      Over 50% of species died in each
      Possible total of 20 mass extinctions
      Current mass extinction in progress
    Causes of Extinctions
      Environmental changes
      Lack of necessary traits for survival
      Major catastrophes (volcanic eruptions, earthquakes)
    Notable Extinctions
      Permian Extinction
        99.5% of individual organisms extinct
        95% of marine species perished
        Possible cause: formation of Pangaea
      Cretaceous Extinction
        Dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago
        Possible cause: asteroid/comet collision
        Evidence: iridium-rich layer in Earth
    Aftermath of Extinctions
      New species evolve to fill habitats
      Documented in fossil record

        Hollow dorsal nerve cord
        Pharyngeal slits
      Invertebrate Chordates
        Tunicates
          Characteristics
            Lose traits by adulthood
            Filter feeders
            Reproduce sexually and asexually
        Lancelets
          Characteristics
            Retain all traits as adults
            Filter feeders

    Comparison
      Echinoderms vs Chordates
        Echinoderms are invertebrates
        Chordates include vertebrates and invertebrates
      Tunicates vs Lancelets
        Tunicates lose traits; Lancelets retain traits

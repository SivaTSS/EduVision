  Extinction and Radiation of Life
    Phylogenetic Tree
      Indicates branches
    Species Disappearance
      Two possibilities
        Complete extinction
        Evolution into different species
    Speciation
      Mating ability requirement
    Changing Environment
      Forces two outcomes
        Extinction
        Evolution
      Impact on biodiversity
    Natural Selection
      Example: Three-spined sticklebacks

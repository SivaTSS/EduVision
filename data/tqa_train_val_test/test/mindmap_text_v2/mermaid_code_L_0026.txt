    Air Masses
      Definition
        Large body of air with uniform conditions
      Types
        Continental Polar
        Maritime Tropical
      Movement
        Caused by winds and jet streams
        Cold air moves south
        Warm air moves north
    Fronts
      Definition
        Boundary between two air masses
      Types

          Characteristics
            Cold air mass moves faster
            Causes storms and precipitation
        Warm Front
          Characteristics
            Warm air rises over cold air
            Brings light precipitation
        Occluded Front
          Characteristics
            Warm air trapped between cold air
            Causes cloudy weather and precipitation
        Stationary Front
          Characteristics
            Stalled air masses
            May bring prolonged precipitation

      Cyclone
        Definition
          Winds rotating around low pressure
        Weather
          Brings cloudy, wet conditions
      Anticyclone
        Definition
          Winds rotating around high pressure

  Amontons Law
    Demonstration
      Pressure inside can
      Volume constant after heating
      Pressure lower after cooling
    Definition
      Increasing temperature increases pressure
      Constant volume
    Experiment
      Sealed jug with air
      Heating air increases temperature
      Pressure change
    Explanation
      Gas particles gain energy
      Increased collisions
      Greater pressure
    Real-world example
      Tire pressure change
      Friction generates heat
      Constant volume in tire
      Increased pressure due to heat
    Historical context
      Proposed by Guillaume Amontons
      Late 1600s
      Part of gas laws
        Boyle's Law
        Charles's Law

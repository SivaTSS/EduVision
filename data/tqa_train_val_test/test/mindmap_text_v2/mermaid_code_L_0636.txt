    Xylem and Phloem
      Xylem
        Transports water and nutrients
        Structure similarities with phloem
      Phloem
        Transports sugars
        Structure similarities with xylem
    Stomata
      Pores for gas exchange
      Can open and close
      Prevents water loss
    Vascular Tissue
      Specialized for transport
      Necessary for land survival

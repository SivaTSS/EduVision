  Structural Evidence for Evolution
    Vestigial Structures
      Definition: Structures that have lost their use through evolution
      Examples
        Flightless Cormorant
          Vestigial trait: Wings
          Compensation: Adapted for swimming
        Penguins
          Use of wings: Flippers for swimming
        Whales
          Vestigial structure: Pelvic bones
    Homologous Structures
      Definition: Structures with a common function suggesting common ancestry
      Examples
        Mammal limbs
          Functions: Walking, running, swimming, flying
    Embryology
      Definition: Study of organism development
      Evidence of common ancestry
        Similar appearances in embryos
        Example: Human embryos with gill slits
          Disappearance before birth
        Relation to other species
          Common ancestor with chimpanzees

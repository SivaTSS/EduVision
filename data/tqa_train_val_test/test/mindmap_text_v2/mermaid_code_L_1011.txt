  Experiments
    What is an experiment?
      Definition: Controlled scientific study of specific variables
      Variables: Factors that can take on different values
    Types of Variables
      Manipulated Variable
        Definition: Changed by the researcher
        Also known as: Independent variable
      Responding Variable
        Definition: Predicted to change if manipulated variable changes
        Also known as: Dependent variable
    Importance of Controlled Variables
      Definition: Variables held constant to avoid influencing outcomes
      Example: Smoothness of ramps in an experiment
    Experiment Example
      Scenario: Sliding wooden blocks down a ramp
      Manipulated Variable: Steepness of the ramp
      Observations: 
        Block on gentler slope reaches bottom sooner
        Explanation: Smoothness affected speed, not just steepness
    Experimental Controls
      Definition: Variables held constant for comparison
      Importance: Ensures valid results
      Example: Using identical blocks to control for block variables

        - Air
        - Sunlight
        - Soil
        - Water
        - Minerals
    Biotic Factors
      - Living parts

    Energy Flow
      - Producers
        - Use sunlight (photosynthesis)
        - Use chemicals (chemosynthesis)
      - Consumers
        - Types: Grazers, Predators, Scavengers
      - Decomposers
        - Break down dead organisms
    Food Chains and Food Webs
      - Food Chain
        - Simple energy flow diagram
        - Levels: Producers, Primary consumers, Secondary consumers
      - Food Web
        - Complex diagram of overlapping food chains
    Matter Recycling
      - Nutrients
        - Nonliving matter needed for life
        - Examples: Carbon, Nitrogen
      - Cycle of matter
        - Decomposers release nutrients
        - Nutrients uptake by plants
        - Transfer through consumers

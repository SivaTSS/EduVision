  Microevolution and Macroevolution
    Microevolution
      Definition
        Small changes in organisms over time
        Changes within a species
      Factors
        Natural selection
        Genetic drift
        Mutation
        Gene flow
      Examples
        Pesticide-resistant mosquitoes
      Outcomes
        Changes in allele frequency
        Does not create new species
    Macroevolution
      Definition
        Larger evolutionary changes
        Results in new species
      Causes
        Repeated microevolution
        Major environmental changes
      Examples
        Darwin's finches
      Concepts
        Phyletic gradualism
        Punctuated equilibrium
    Cambrian Explosion
      Definition
        Rapid diversification of life
      Timing
        Occurred during the Cambrian Period
      Relation to Evolution
        Represents macroevolution
      Causes
        Various hypotheses
      Fossil Comparison
        Similarity to current body plans
    Species Definition
      Characteristics
        Genetically similar organisms
        Ability to produce fertile offspring
      Population
        Group of the same species in a specific area

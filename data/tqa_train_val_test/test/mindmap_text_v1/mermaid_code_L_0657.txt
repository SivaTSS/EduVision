  Ferns and Seedless Plants
    Reproduction
      Asexual
        Fragmentation
      Sexual
        Gametophyte
          Male
            Produces flagellated sperm
          Female
            Produces eggs
        Fertilization
          Requires water
    Life Cycle
      Nonvascular Plants
        Dominant Stage: Gametophyte (Haploid)
          Green photosynthetic carpet (Moss)
        Process
          1. Male gametophyte produces sperm
          2. Sperm swims to egg
          3. Sporophyte forms, dependent on gametophyte
          4. Sporophyte produces spores
      Vascular Plants
        Dominant Stage: Sporophyte (Diploid)
          Recognizable leafy fern
        Process
          1. Gametophyte is heart-shaped
          2. Fertilization occurs
          3. Gametophyte dies, sporophyte lives independently
    Key Concepts
      Alternation of Generations
        Diploid and haploid stages
      Moist Environments
        Necessary for reproduction
      Sorus
        Location: Underside of fronds
        Contains spores
      Antheridiogen
        Effect on gametophyte development

  Air Pressure and Altitude
    Changes in Air Pressure
      From Sea Level to Top of Atmosphere
      Greatest at Earth's Surface
      Decreases with Altitude
    Factors Affecting Atmospheric Pressure
      Density of Atmosphere
        Gas Molecules Pulled by Gravity
        More Collisions = Greater Pressure
      Depth of Atmosphere
        Greatest at Sea Level
        Decreases with Altitude
    Breathing and Air Pressure
      Mechanism of Breathing
        Air Pressure Allows Breathing
      Sipping Through a Straw
        Lower Pressure in Straw
        Fluid Flows from High to Low Pressure

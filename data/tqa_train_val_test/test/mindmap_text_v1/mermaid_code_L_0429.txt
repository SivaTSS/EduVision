  Mendel's Discoveries
    Gregor Mendel
      Background
        Austrian monk
        Mid-1800s research
      Traits
        Offspring similarity
        Factors controlling traits
    Pea Plants
      Advantages
        Easy to grow
        Quick growth
        Observable traits
        Two forms per trait
      Reproduction
        Sexual reproduction
        Pollination process
    Mendel's Experiments
      One Trait Experiments
        Law of Segregation
          Factors separate into gametes
          Example: Flower color
            F1 generation results
            F2 generation results
              3:1 ratio
      Two Trait Experiments
        Law of Independent Assortment
          Factors for different traits assort independently
          Example: Seed shape and color
            F1 generation results
            F2 generation results
              9:3:3:1 ratio
    Scientific Legacy
      Ignored until 1900
      Rediscovery by other scientists
      Father of Genetics
        Basis of modern genetics

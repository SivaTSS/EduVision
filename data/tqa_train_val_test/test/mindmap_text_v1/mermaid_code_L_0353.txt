  Weather Maps
    Purpose
      Graphical depiction of weather conditions
      Display of meteorological features
      Use of computer models and human observations
    Isolines
      Definition
        Lines connecting points of equal value
      Types
        Isotherms
          Constant temperature
          Indicate fronts
        Isobars
          Constant pressure
          Indicate pressure cells
        Isotachs
          Constant wind speed
    High and Low Pressure
      Identification
        High pressure areas
          Symbol: H
          Characteristics in real life
        Low pressure areas
          Symbol: L
          Characteristics in real life
      Without Symbols
        Identifying high pressure
        Identifying low pressure
    Fronts
      Definition
        Boundary between different air masses
      Appearance on Weather Map
        Cold front
          Symbol: blue line with triangles
        Warm front
          Symbol: red line with semicircles
        Stationary front
          Symbol: alternating red and blue lines
        Occluded front
          Symbol: purple line with alternating triangles and semicircles
    Wind Patterns
      Relation to Pressure Cells
        Wind direction around high pressure
        Wind direction around low pressure
    Isoline Spacing
      Close isolines indicate
        Steep gradients
        Rapid changes in weather conditions

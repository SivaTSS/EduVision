  Oceanic Pressure
    Water Pressure Changes
      Increases with Depth
        10 kPa per Meter
        Double at 30 Meters
        Extreme at 500 Meters
        Tremendous at 11,000 Meters
    Effects on Divers
      Difficulty Exploring Deep Ocean
      Use of Pressure-Resistant Vehicles
      Scuba Diving Limitations
        Safe Depth Limit
        Slow Ascent Required
          Stops for Pressure Adjustment
          Risks of Rapid Ascent
            Gas Bubbles Formation
              Less Gas Solubility at Lower Pressure

  Fluid Pressure
    Definition
      - Pressure = Force / Area
      - SI Unit: Pascal (Pa)
    Factors Affecting Pressure
      - Depth
      - Density
    Pascal's Law
      - Change in pressure transmitted equally in enclosed fluid
      - Applications: Hydraulic systems (e.g., car lifts)
    Bernoulli's Law
      - Pressure in moving fluid decreases with speed
      - Applications: Lift in airplanes and birds
    Pressure Calculation
      - Formula: Pressure = Force / Area
      - Example Problems
        - Box on ground
        - Break dancer's pressure
    Fluid Behavior
      - Movement of particles
      - Pressure exerted in all directions
    Real-World Applications
      - Bicycle pumps
      - Sipping through a straw
      - Sailing physics

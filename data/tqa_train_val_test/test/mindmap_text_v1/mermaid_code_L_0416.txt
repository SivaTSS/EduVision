  Ecosystem Change
    Ecological Succession
      Definition
        Process of species change over time
      Types
        Primary Succession
          Occurs in uncolonized areas
          Pioneer Species
            Bacteria
            Lichens
          Stages
            Bare rock to soil formation
            Initial plants (grasses)
        Secondary Succession
          Occurs in disturbed areas
          Pioneer Species
            Small plants (grasses, fireweed)
          Causes
            Fire
            Flood
            Human actions (farming)
      Climax Community
        Definition
          Final stable state of an ecosystem
        Likelihood
          Unlikely due to frequent disturbances
    Human Impact
      Environmental Problems
        Types of problems caused by human actions
      Effects on Living Things
        Impact on ecosystems and species
    Comparison
      Primary vs. Secondary Succession
        Primary
          Bare rock, slower process
        Secondary
          Disturbed area, faster process

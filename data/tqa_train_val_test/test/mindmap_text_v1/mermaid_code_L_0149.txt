  Climate Influences
    Maritime Climate
      Definition
        Influenced by nearby ocean
        Less extreme temperatures
      Characteristics
        Small seasonal and daily temperature variation
        Winds predominantly from the sea
      Examples
        San Francisco
          Influenced by California Current
          Affected by coastal upwelling
        Virginia Beach
          Near Atlantic Ocean
          Less ocean influence due to wind direction
    Continental Climate
      Definition
        Influenced by nearby land
        More extreme temperatures
      Characteristics
        Greater temperature differences
          Day vs. night
          Summer vs. winter
      Examples
        Wichita
          Exhibits extreme continental climate
    Oceanic Influence
      Temperature Effects
        Offshore currents affect coastal temperatures
        Cool California Current moderates temperatures
        Upwelling brings cold water to surface
      Regional Variations
        Southern Alaska
          Warmer land temperatures due to warm ocean water
        Gulf Stream
          Important for northern Europe's climate

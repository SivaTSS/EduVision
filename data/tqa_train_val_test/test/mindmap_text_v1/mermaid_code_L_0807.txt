  Bernoulli's Law
    Definition
      - Pressure of moving fluid
      - Relationship with fluid speed
    Historical Context
      - Named after Daniel Bernoulli
      - Swiss mathematician
      - Discovery in the 1700s
    Application in Aviation
      - Wings of airplanes
        - Shape of wings
        - Airflow dynamics
        - Pressure difference
      - Lift generation
        - Greater pressure below wings
        - Allows flight
